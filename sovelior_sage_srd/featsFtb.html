      <h5>BLIND-FIGHT [GENERAL]</h5>
      <p class="initial"><b>Benefit</b>: In melee, every time you miss
because of concealment, you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll
one time to see if you actually hit.</p>
      <p>An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting
you in melee. That is, you don&#8217;t lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor
Class, and the attacker doesn&#8217;t get the usual +2 bonus for being
invisible. The invisible attacker&#8217;s bonuses do still apply for ranged
attacks, however.</p>
      <p>You take only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable
to see. Darkness and poor visibility in general reduces your speed to
three-quarters normal, instead of one-half.</p>
      <p><b>Normal</b>: Regular attack roll modifiers for invisible

      <p><b>Benefit</b>: As a standard action, you may fire two arrows

bonuses.</p>

fighter bonus feats.</p>

combat, you may attempt a Ride check (as a reaction) to negate the hit.

opponent&#8217;s attack roll. (Essentially, the Ride check result becomes the
mount&#8217;s Armor Class if it&#8217;s higher than the mount&#8217;s regular AC.)</p>

on damage apply until your next turn.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: If you attack with a two-handed weapon, or
with a one-handed weapon wielded in two hands, instead add twice the
number subtracted from your attack rolls. You can&#8217;t add the bonus from
Power Attack to the damage dealt with a light weapon (except with
unarmed strikes or natural weapon attacks), even though the penalty on
attack rolls still applies. (Normally, you treat a double weapon as a
one-handed weapon and a light weapon. If you choose to use a double
weapon like a two-handed weapon, attacking with only one end of it in a
round, you treat it as a two-handed weapon.)</p>
      <p>A fighter may select Power Attack as one of his fighter bonus

      <p>A character who has selected this feat may throw weapons at
his full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with a bow).</p>
      <p><b>Normal</b>: Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a

action as part of movement. Without this feat, you can draw a hidden
weapon as a standard action.</p>

      <p><b>Benefit</b>: The time required for you to reload your
chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a free action (for a hand or
light crossbow) or a move action (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a
crossbow still provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>

crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full attack
action as you could attack if you were using a bow.</p>

action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a full-round action to
reload a heavy crossbow.</p>

time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow.</p>

feats.</p>

      <p class="initial"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Dex 13, Point Blank Shot.</p>
      <p><b>Benefit</b>: You can get one extra attack per round with a
ranged weapon. The attack is at your highest base attack bonus, but
each attack you make in that round (the extra one and the normal ones)
takes a &#8211;2 penalty. You must use the full attack action to use this
feat.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A fighter may select Rapid Shot as one of his
fighter bonus feats.</p>
      <p>A 2nd-level ranger who has chosen the archery combat style is
treated as having Rapid Shot, even if he does not have the

his fighter bonus feats.</p>
      <h5>SHOT ON THE RUN [GENERAL]</h5>

      <p><b>Benefit</b>: When using the Deflect Arrows feat you may
catch the weapon instead of just deflecting it. Thrown weapons can
immediately be thrown back at the original attacker (even though it
isn&#8217;t your turn) or kept for later use.</p>
      <p>You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use
this feat.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A fighter may select Snatch Arrows as one of
his fighter bonus feats.</p>
      <h5>SPIRITED CHARGE [GENERAL]</h5>
      <p class="initial"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Ride 1 rank, Mounted
Combat, Ride-By Attack.</p>
      <p><b>Benefit</b>: When mounted and using the charge action, you
deal double damage with a melee weapon (or triple damage with a lance).</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A fighter may select Spirited Charge as one of
his fighter bonus feats.</p>
      <h5>SPRING ATTACK [GENERAL]</h5>
      <p class="initial"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Dex 13, Dodge, Mobility,
base attack bonus +4.</p>
      <p><b>Benefit</b>: When using the attack action with a melee
weapon, you can move both before and after the attack, provided that
your total distance moved is not greater than your speed. Moving in
this way does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender
you attack, though it might provoke attacks of opportunity from other
creatures, if appropriate. You can&#8217;t use this feat if you are wearing
heavy armor.</p>
      <p>You must move at least 5 feet both before and after you make
your attack in order to utilize the benefits of Spring Attack.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A fighter may select Spring Attack as one of
his fighter bonus feats.</p>
      <h5>STUNNING FIST [GENERAL]</h5>
      <p class="initial"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved
Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.</p>
      <p><b>Benefit</b>: You must declare that you are using this feat
before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the
attempt). Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to
make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your
Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who
fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before your
next action). A stunned character can&#8217;t act, loses any Dexterity bonus
to AC, and takes a &#8211;2 penalty to AC. You may attempt a stunning attack
once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special),
and no more than once per round. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead,
incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be
stunned.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A monk may select Stunning Fist as a bonus
feat at 1st level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. A monk
who selects this feat may attempt a stunning attack a number of times
per day equal to her monk level, plus one more time per day for every
four levels she has in classes other than monk.</p>
      <p>A fighter may select Stunning Fist as one of his fighter bonus
feats.</p>
      <h5>TRAMPLE [GENERAL]</h5>
      <p class="initial"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Ride 1 rank, Mounted
Combat.</p>
      <p><b>Benefit</b>: When you attempt to overrun an opponent while
mounted, your target may not choose to avoid you. Your mount may make
one hoof attack against any target you knock down, gaining the standard
+4 bonus on attack rolls against prone targets.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A fighter may select Trample as one of his
fighter bonus feats.</p>
      <h5>TWO-WEAPON DEFENSE [GENERAL]</h5>
      <p class="initial"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Dex 15, Two-Weapon
Fighting.</p>
      <p><b>Benefit</b>: When wielding a double weapon or two weapons
(not including natural weapons or unarmed strikes), you gain a +1
shield bonus to your AC.</p>
      <p>When you are fighting defensively or using the total defense
action, this shield bonus increases to +2.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A fighter may select Two-Weapon Defense as one
of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
      <h5>TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING [GENERAL]</h5>
      <p class="initial">You can fight with a weapon in each hand. You
can make one extra attack each round with the second weapon.</p>
      <p><b>Prerequisite</b>: Dex 15.</p>
      <p><b>Benefit</b>: Your penalties on attack rolls for fighting
with two weapons are reduced. The penalty for your primary hand lessens
by 2 and the one for your off hand lessens by 6.</p>
      <p><b>Normal</b>: If you wield a second weapon in your off hand,
you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. When fighting
in this way you suffer a &#8211;6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks
with your primary hand and a &#8211;10 penalty to the attack with your off
hand. If your off-hand weapon is light the penalties are reduced by 2
each. (An unarmed strike is always considered light.)</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A 2nd-level ranger who has chosen the
two-weapon combat style is treated as having Two-Weapon Fighting, even
if he does not have the prerequisite for it, but only when he is
wearing light or no armor.</p>
      <p>A fighter may select Two-Weapon Fighting as one of his fighter
bonus feats.</p>
      <h5>WEAPON FINESSE [GENERAL]</h5>
      <p class="initial"><b>Prerequisite</b>: Base attack bonus +1.</p>
      <p><b>Benefit</b>: With a light weapon, rapier, whip, or spiked
chain made for a creature of your size category, you may use your
Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls.
If you carry a shield, its armor check penalty applies to your attack
rolls.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A fighter may select Weapon Finesse as one of
his fighter bonus feats.</p>
      <p>Natural weapons are always considered light weapons.</p>
      <h5>WEAPON FOCUS [GENERAL]</h5>
      <p class="initial">Choose one type of weapon. You can also choose
unarmed strike or grapple (or ray, if you are a spellcaster) as your
weapon for purposes of this feat.</p>
      <p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Proficiency with selected weapon, base
attack bonus +1.</p>
      <p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls you
make using the selected weapon.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its
effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new
type of weapon.</p>
      <p>A fighter may select Weapon Focus as one of his fighter bonus
feats. He must have Weapon Focus with a weapon to gain the Weapon
Specialization feat for that weapon.</p>
      <h5>WEAPON SPECIALIZATION [GENERAL]</h5>
      <p class="initial">Choose one type of weapon for which you have
already selected the Weapon Focus feat. You can also choose unarmed
strike or grapple as your weapon for purposes of this feat. You deal
extra damage when using this weapon.</p>
      <p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Proficiency with selected weapon, Weapon
Focus with selected weapon, fighter level 4th.</p>
      <p><b>Benefit</b>: You gain a +2 bonus on all damage rolls you

      <h5>WHIRLWIND ATTACK [GENERAL]</h5>
      <p class="initial"><b>Prerequisites</b>: Dex 13, Int 13, Combat
Expertise, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, base attack bonus +4.</p>
      <p><b>Benefit</b>: When you use the full attack action, you can
give up your regular attacks and instead make one melee attack at your
full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach.</p>
      <p>When you use the Whirlwind Attack feat, you also forfeit any
bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats, spells, or abilities.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A fighter may select Whirlwind Attack as one
of his fighter bonus feats.</p>
