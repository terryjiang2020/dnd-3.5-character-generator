      </h5>

The four basic dungeon types are defined by their current status. Many
dungeons are variations on these basic types or combinations of more
than one of them. Sometimes old dungeons are used again and again by
different inhabitants for different purposes.
      
      <a id="ruined-structure"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ruined Structure:</span> Once
occupied, this place is now abandoned (completely or in part) by its
original creator or creators, and other creatures have wandered in.
Many subterranean creatures look for abandoned underground
constructions in which to make their lairs. Any traps that might exist
have probably been set off, but wandering beasts might very well be
common.</p>

      
      <a id="occupied-structure"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Occupied Structure:</span>
This type of dungeon is still in use. Creatures (usually intelligent)
live there, although they may not be the dungeon&rsquo;s creators. An
occupied structure might be a home, a fortress, a temple, an active
mine, a prison, or a headquarters. This type of dungeon is less likely
to have traps or wandering beasts, and more likely to have organized
guards-both on watch and on patrol. Traps or wandering beasts that
might be encountered are usually under the control of the occupants.
Occupied structures have furnishings to suit the inhabitants, as well
as decorations, supplies, and the ability for occupants to move around
(doors they can open, hallways large enough for them to pass through,
and so on). The inhabitants might have a communication system, and they
almost certainly control an access to the outside.</p>

      
      <p>Some dungeons are partially occupied and partially empty or in
ruins. In such cases, the occupants are typically not the original
builders but instead a group of intelligent creatures that have set up
their base, lair, or fortification within an abandoned dungeon.</p>

      
      <a id="safe-storage"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Safe Storage:</span> When
people want to protect something, they might bury it underground.
Whether the item they want to protect is a fabulous treasure, a
forbidden artifact, or the dead body of an important figure, these
valuable objects are placed within a dungeon and surrounded by
barriers, traps, and guardians.</p>

      
      <p>The safe storage type of dungeon is the most likely to have
traps but the least likely to have wandering beasts. This type of
dungeon normally is built for function rather than appearance, but
sometimes it has ornamentation in the form of statuary or painted
walls. This is particularly true of the tombs of important people.</p>

      
      <p>Sometimes, however, a vault or a crypt is constructed in such
a way as to house living guardians. The problem with this strategy is
that something must be done to keep the creatures alive between
intrusion attempts. Magic is usually the best solution to provide food
and water for these creatures. Even if there&rsquo;s no way anything
living
can survive in a safe storage dungeon, certain monsters can still serve
as guardians. Builders of vaults or tombs often place undead creatures
or constructs, both of which which have no need for sustenance or rest,
to guard their dungeons. Magic traps can attack intruders by summoning
monsters into the dungeon. These guardians also need no sustenance,
since they appear only when they&rsquo;re needed and disappear when
their
task is done.</p>

      
      <a id="natural-cavern-complex"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Natural Cavern Complex:</span>
Underground caves provide homes for all sorts of subterranean monsters.
Created naturally and connected by a labyrinthine tunnel system, these
caverns lack any sort of pattern, order, or decoration. With no
intelligent force behind its construction, this type of dungeon is the
least likely to have traps or even doors.</p>

      
      <p>Fungi of all sorts thrive in caves, sometimes growing in huge
forests of mushrooms and puffballs. Subterranean predators prowl these
forests, looking for those feeding upon the fungi. Some varieties of
fungus give off a phosphorescent glow, providing a natural cavern
complex with its own limited light source. In other areas, a <a href="spellsDtoE.html#daylight" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">daylight</a>
spell or similar magical effect can provide enough light for green
plants to grow.</p>

      
      <p class="initial">Often, a natural cavern complex connects with
another type of dungeons, the caves having been discovered when the
manufactured dungeon was delved. A cavern complex can connect two
otherwise unrelated dungeons, sometimes creating a strange mixed
environment. A natural cavern complex joined with another dungeon often
provides a route by which subterranean creatures find their way into a
manufactured dungeon and populate it.<br />

      <h5><a id="walls"></a>WALLS</h5>

Sometimes, masonry walls-stones piled on top of each other (usually but
not always held in place with mortar)-divide dungeons into corridors
and chambers. Dungeon walls can also be hewn from solid rock, leaving
them with a rough, chiseled look. Or, dungeon walls can be the smooth,
unblemished stone of a naturally occurring cave. Dungeon walls are
difficult to break down or through, but they&rsquo;re generally easy to
climb.<br />

      <a id="masonry-walls"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Masonry Walls:</span> The
most common kind of dungeon wall, masonry walls are usually at least 1
foot thick. Often these ancient walls sport cracks and crevices, and
sometimes dangerous slimes or small monsters live in these areas and
wait for prey. Masonry walls stop all but the loudest noises. It takes
a DC 20 <a href="skillsAll.html#climb" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Climb</a> check to travel along a
masonry wall.</p>

      
      <a id="superior-masonry-walls"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Superior Masonry Walls:</span>
Sometimes masonry walls are better built (smoother, with
tighter-fitting stones and less cracking), and occasionally these
superior walls are covered with plaster or stucco. Covered walls often
bear paintings, carved reliefs, or other decoration. Superior masonry
walls are no more difficult to destroy than regular masonry walls but
are more difficult to climb (DC 25).</p>

      
      <a id="hewn-stone-walls"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hewn Stone Walls:</span> Such
walls usually result when a chamber or passage is tunneled out from
solid rock. The rough surface of a hewn wall frequently provides
minuscule ledges where fungus grows and fissures where vermin, bats,
and subterranean snakes live. When such a wall has an &ldquo;other
side&rdquo; (it
separates two chambers in the dungeon), the wall is usually at least 3
feet thick; anything thinner risks collapsing from the weight of all
the stone overhead. It takes a DC 25 Climb check to climb a hewn stone
wall.</p>

      
      <a id="unworked-stone-walls"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unworked Stone Walls:</span>
These surfaces are uneven and rarely flat. They are smooth to the touch
but filled with tiny holes, hidden alcoves, and ledges at various
heights. They&rsquo;re also usually wet or at least damp, since
it&rsquo;s water
that most frequently creates natural caves. When such a wall has an
&ldquo;other side,&rdquo; the wall is usually at least 5 feet thick. It
takes a DC
15 Climb check to move along an unworked stone wall.<br />

      </p>

      
      <a id="special-walls"></a><h6>Special Walls</h6>

      <a id="reinforced-walls"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reinforced Walls:</span> These
are masonry walls with iron bars on one or both sides of the wall, or
placed within the wall to strengthen it. The hardness of a reinforced
wall remains the same, but its hit points are doubled and the Strength
check DC to break through it is increased by 10.
      
      <a id="iron-walls"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Iron Walls:</span> These
walls are placed within dungeons around important places such as
vaults. </p>

      
      <a id="paper-walls"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Paper Walls:</span> Paper
walls are the opposite of iron walls, placed as screens to block line
of sight but nothing more.</p>

      
      <a id="wooden-walls"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wooden Walls:</span> Wooden
walls often exist as recent additions to older dungeons, used to create
animal pens, storage bins, or just to make a number of smaller rooms
out of a larger one.</p>

      
      <a id="magically-treated-walls"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Magically Treated Walls:</span>
These walls are stronger than average, with a greater hardness, more
hit points, and a higher break DC. Magic can usually double the
hardness and hit points and can add up to 20 to the break DC. A
magically treated wall also gains a saving throw against spells that
could affect it, with the save bonus equaling 2 + one-half the caster
level of the magic reinforcing the wall. Creating a magic wall requires
the <a href="featsAll.html#craft-wondrous-item" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Craft Wondrous Item</a> feat and the
expenditure of 1,500 gp for each 10 foot-by-10-foot wall section.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a id="walls-with-arrow-slits"></a>Walls with Arrow Slits:</span>
Walls with arrow slits can be made of any durable material but are most
commonly masonry, hewn stone, or wood. Such a wall allows defenders to
fire arrows or crossbow bolts at intruders from behind the safety of
the wall. Archers behind arrow slits have improved cover that gives
them a +8 bonus to Armor Class, a +4 bonus on Reflex saves, and the
benefits of the improved evasion class feature.<br />

      </p>

      
      <h5><a id="floors"></a>FLOORS</h5>

As with walls, dungeon floors come in many types.
      
      <a id="flagstone"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flagstone:</span> Like
masonry walls, flagstone floors are made of fitted stones. They are
usually cracked and only somewhat level. Slime and mold grows in these
cracks. Sometimes water runs in rivulets between the stones or sits in
stagnant puddles. Flagstone is the most common dungeon floor.</p>

      
      <a id="uneven-flagstone"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Uneven Flagstone:</span> Over
time, some floors can become so uneven that a DC 10 <a href="skillsAll.html#balance" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Balance</a>
check is required to run or charge across the surface. Failure means
the character can&rsquo;t move in this round. Floors as treacherous as
this
should be the exception, not the rule.</p>

      
      <a id="hewn-stone-floor"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hewn Stone Floors:</span>
Rough and uneven, hewn floors are usually covered with loose stones,
gravel, dirt, or other debris. A DC 10 Balance check is required to run
or charge across such a floor. Failure means the character can still
act, but can&rsquo;t run or charge in this round.</p>

      
      <a id="light-rubble"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Light Rubble:</span> Small
chunks of debris litter the ground. Light rubble adds 2 to the DC of
Balance and <a href="skillsAll.html#tumble" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Tumble</a> checks.</p>

      
      <a id="dense-rubble"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dense Rubble:</span> The
ground is covered with debris of all sizes. It costs 2 squares of
movement to enter a square with dense rubble. Dense rubble adds 5 to
the DC of Balance and Tumble checks, and it adds 2 to the DC of <a href="skillsAll.html#move-silently" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Move
Silently</a> checks.</p>

      
      <a id="smooth-stone-floor"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Smooth Stone Floors:</span>
Finished and sometimes even polished, smooth floors are found only in
dungeons with capable and careful builders. </p>

      
      <a id="natural-stone-floor"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Natural Stone Floors:</span>
The floor of a natural cave is as uneven as the walls. Caves rarely
have flat surfaces of any great size. Rather, their floors have many
levels. Some adjacent floor surfaces might vary in elevation by only a
foot, so that moving from one to the other is no more difficult than
negotiating a stair step, but in other places the floor might suddenly
drop off or rise up several feet or more, requiring Climb checks to get
from one surface to the other. Unless a path has been worn and well
marked in the floor of a natural cave, it takes 2 squares of movement
to enter a square with a natural stone floor, and the DC of Balance and
Tumble checks increases by 5. Running and charging are impossible,
except along paths.<br />

      </p>

      
      <h6><a id="special-floors"></a>Special Floors</h6>

      <a id="slippery"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Slippery:</span> Water, ice,
slime, or blood can make any of the dungeon floors described in this
section more treacherous. Slippery floors increase the DC of <a href="skillsAll.html#balance" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Balance</a>
and <a href="skillsAll.html#tumble" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Tumble</a>
checks by 5.
      
      <a id="grate"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Grate:</span> A grate often
covers a pit or an area lower than the main floor. Grates are usually
made from iron, but large ones can also be made from iron-bound
timbers. Many grates have hinges to allow access to what lies below
(such grates can be locked like any door), while others are permanent
and designed not to move. A typical 1-inch-thick iron grate has 25 hit
points, hardness 10, and a DC of 27 for Strength checks to break
through it or tear it loose.</p>

      
      <a id="ledge"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ledge:</span> Ledges allow
creatures to walk above some lower area. They often circle around pits,
run along underground streams, form balconies around large rooms, or
provide a place for archers to stand while firing upon enemies below.
Narrow ledges (12 inches wide or less) require those moving along them
to make Balance checks. Failure results in the moving character falling
off the ledge. Ledges sometimes have railings. In such a case,
characters gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Balance checks to move along
the ledge. A character who is next to a railing gains a +2 circumstance
bonus on his or her opposed Strength check to avoid being bull rushed
off the edge.</p>

      
      <p>Ledges can also have low walls 2 to 3 feet high along their
edges. Such walls provide cover against attackers within 30 feet on the
other side of the wall, as long as the target is closer to the low wall
than the attacker is.</p>

      
      <a id="transparent-floor"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Transparent Floor:</span>
Transparent floors, made of reinforced glass or magic materials (even a
      <a href="spellsTtoZ.html#wall-of-force" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">wall of force</a>), allow a
dangerous setting to be viewed safely from above. Transparent floors
are sometimes placed over lava pools, arenas, monster dens, and torture
chambers. They can be used by defenders to watch key areas for
intruders.</p>

      
      <a id="sliding-floor"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sliding Floors:</span> A
sliding floor is a type of trapdoor, designed to be moved and thus
reveal something that lies beneath it. A typical sliding floor moves so
slowly that anyone standing on one can avoid falling into the gap it
creates, assuming there&rsquo;s somewhere else to go. If such a floor
slides
quickly enough that there&rsquo;s a chance of a character falling into
whatever lies beneath-a spiked pit, a vat of burning oil, or a pool
filled with sharks-then it&rsquo;s a trap.</p>

      
      <a id="trap-floors"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Trap Floors:</span> Some
floors are designed to become suddenly dangerous. With the application
of just the right amount of weight, or the pull of a lever somewhere
nearby, spikes protrude from the floor, gouts of steam or flame shoot
up from hidden holes, or the entire floor tilts. These strange floors
are sometimes found in an arena, designed to make combats more exciting
and deadly. Construct these floors as you would any other trap.<br />

      <a id="wooden-doors"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wooden Doors:</span>
Constructed of thick planks nailed together, sometimes bound with iron
for strength (and to reduce swelling from dungeon dampness), wooden
doors are the most common type. Wooden doors come in varying strengths:
simple, good, and strong doors. Simple doors (break DC 13) are not
meant to keep out motivated attackers. Good doors (break DC 16), while
sturdy and long-lasting, are still not meant to take much punishment.
Strong doors (break DC 23) are bound in iron and are a sturdy barrier
to those attempting to get past them. Iron hinges fasten the door to
its frame, and typically a circular pull-ring in the center is there to
help open it. Sometimes, instead of a pull-ring, a door has an iron
pull-bar on one or both sides of the door to serve as a handle. In
inhabited dungeons, these doors are usually well maintained (not stuck)
and unlocked, although important areas are locked up if possible.</p>

      
      <a id="stone"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stone:</span> Carved from
solid blocks of stone, these heavy, unwieldy doors are often built so
that they pivot when opened, although dwarves and other skilled
craftsfolk are able to fashion hinges strong enough to hold up a stone
door. Secret doors concealed within a stone wall are usually stone
doors. Otherwise, such doors stand as tough barriers protecting
something important beyond. Thus, they are often locked or barred.</p>

      
      <a id="iron"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Iron:</span> Rusted but
sturdy, iron doors in a dungeon are hinged like wooden doors. These
doors are the toughest form of nonmagical door. They are usually locked
or barred.</p>

      
      <a id="locks-bars-and-seals"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Locks, Bars, and Seals:</span>
Dungeon doors may be locked, trapped, reinforced, barred, magically
sealed, or sometimes just stuck. All but the weakest characters can
eventually knock down a door with a heavy tool such as a sledgehammer,
and a number of spells and magic items give characters an easy way
around a locked door.</p>

      
      <p>Attempts to literally chop a door down with a slashing or
bludgeoning weapon use the hardness and hit points given in Table:
Doors. Often the easiest way to overcome a recalcitrant door is not by
demolishing it but by breaking its lock, bar, or hinges. When assigning
a DC to an attempt to knock a door down, use the following as
guidelines:</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">DC 10 or Lower:</span> a
door just about anyone can break open.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">DC 11-15:</span> a door that
a strong person could break with one try and an average person might be
able to<br />

break with one try. </p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">DC 16-20:</span> a door that
almost anyone could break, given time.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">DC 21-25:</span> a door that
only a strong or very strong person has a hope of breaking, probably
not on the first try.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">DC 26 or Higher:</span> a
door that only an exceptionally strong person has a hope of breaking.</p>

      
      <p>For specific examples in applying these guidelines, see Table:
Random Door Types. </p>

      
      <a id="locks"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Locks:</span> Dungeon doors
are often locked, and thus the <a href="skillsAll.html#open-lock" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Open Lock</a> skill comes in very
handy. Locks are usually built into the door, either on the edge
opposite the hinges or right in the middle of the door. Builtin locks
either control an iron bar that juts out of the door and into the wall
of its frame, or else a sliding iron bar or heavy wooden bar that rests
behind the entire door. By contrast, padlocks are not built-in but
usually run through two rings, one on the door and the other on the
wall. More complex locks, such as combination locks and puzzle locks,
are usually built into the door itself. Because such keyless locks are
larger and more complex, they are typically only found in sturdy doors
(strong wooden, stone, or iron doors).</p>

      
      <p>The Open Lock DC to pick a lock often falls into the range of
20 to 30, although locks with lower or higher DCs can exist. A door can
have more than one lock, each of which must be unlocked separately.
Locks are often trapped, usually with poison needles that extend out to
prick a rogue&rsquo;s finger.</p>

      
      <p>Breaking a lock is sometimes quicker than breaking the whole
door. If a PC wants to whack at a lock with a weapon, treat the typical
lock as having hardness 15 and 30 hit points. A lock can only be broken
if it can be attacked separately from the door, which means that a
built-in lock is immune to this sort of treatment. In an occupied
dungeon, every locked door should have a key somewhere. </p>

      
      <p>A special door (see below for examples) might have a lock with
no key, instead requiring that the right combination of nearby levers
must be manipulated or the right symbols must be pressed on a keypad in
the correct sequence to open the door.</p>

      
      <a id="stuck-doors"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stuck Doors:</span> Dungeons
are often damp, and sometimes doors get stuck, particularly wooden
doors. Assume that about 10% of wooden doors and 5% of nonwooden doors
are stuck. These numbers can be doubled (to 20% and 10%, respectively)
for long-abandoned or neglected dungeons.</p>

      
      <a id="barred-doors"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Barred Doors:</span> When
characters try to bash down a barred door, it&rsquo;s the quality of
the bar
that matters, not the material the door is made of. It takes a DC 25
Strength check to break through a door with a wooden bar, and a DC 30
Strength check if the bar is made of iron. Characters can attack the
door and destroy it instead, leaving the bar hanging in the now-open
doorway.</p>

      
      <a id="magic-seals"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Magic Seals:</span> In
addition to magic traps spells such as <a href="spellsAtoB.html#arcane-lock" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">arcane
lock</a> can discourage passage through a door. A door with an arcane
lock spell on it is considered locked even if it doesn&rsquo;t have a
physical lock. It takes a <a href="spellsHtoL.html#knock" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">knock</a> spell, a <a href="spellsDtoE.html#dispel-magic" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">dispel
magic</a> spell, or a successful Strength check&nbsp; to get through
such a door.</p>

      
      <a id="hinges"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hinges:</span> Most doors
have hinges. Obviously, sliding doors do not. (They usually have tracks
or grooves instead, allowing them to slide easily to one side.)</p>

      
      <a id="standard-hinges"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Standard Hinges:</span>
These hinges are metal, joining one edge of the door to the doorframe
or wall. Remember that the door swings open toward the side with the
hinges. (So, if the hinges are on the PCs&rsquo; side, the door opens
toward
them; otherwise it opens away from them.) Adventurers can take the
hinges apart one at a time with successful <a href="skillsAll.html#disable-device" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Disable
Device</a> checks (assuming the hinges are on their side of the door,
of course). Such a task has a DC of 20 because most hinges are rusted
or stuck. Breaking a hinge is difficult. Most have hardness 10 and 30
hit points. The break DC for a hinge is the same as for breaking down
the door.</p>

      
      <a id="nested-hinges"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Nested Hinges:</span> These
hinges are much more complex than ordinary hinges, and are found only
in areas of excellent construction. These hinges are built into the
wall and allow the door to swing open in either direction. PCs
can&rsquo;t
get at the hinges to fool with them unless they break through the
doorframe or wall. Nested hinges are typically found on stone doors but
sometimes on wooden or iron doors as well. </p>

      
      <a id="pivots"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Pivots:</span> Pivots
aren&rsquo;t
really hinges at all, but simple knobs jutting from the top and bottom
of the door that fit into holes in the doorframe, allowing the door to
spin. The advantages of pivots is that they can&rsquo;t be dismantled
like
hinges and they&rsquo;re simple to make. The disadvantage is that since
the
door pivots on its center of gravity (typically in the middle), nothing
larger than half the door&rsquo;s width can fit through. Doors with
pivots
are usually stone and are often quite wide to overcome this
disadvantage. Another solution is to place the pivot toward one side
and have the door be thicker at that end and thinner toward the other
end so that it opens more like a normal door. Secret doors in walls
often turn on pivots, since the lack of hinges makes it easier to hide
the door&rsquo;s presence. Pivots also allow objects such as bookcases
to be
used as secret doors.</p>

      
      <a id="secret-doors"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Secret Doors:</span>
Disguised as a bare patch of wall (or floor, or ceiling), a bookcase, a
fireplace, or a fountain, a secret door leads to a secret passage or
room. Someone examining the area finds a secret door, if one exists, on
a successful <a href="skillsAll.html#search" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Search</a> check (DC 20 for a
typical secret door to DC 30 for a well-hidden secret door). Elves have
a chance to detect a secret door just by casually looking at an area.</p>

      
      <p>Many secret doors require a special method of opening, such as
a hidden button or pressure plate. Secret doors can open like normal
doors, or they may pivot, slide, sink, rise, or even lower like a
drawbridge to permit access. Builders might put a secret door down low
near the floor or high up in a wall, making it difficult to find or
reach. Wizards and sorcerers have a spell, <a href="spellsPtoR.html#phase-door" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">phase
door</a>, that allows them to create a magic secret door that only they
can use.</p>

      
      <a id="magic-doors"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Magic Doors:</span> Enchanted
by the original builders, a door might speak to explorers, warning them
away. It might be protected from harm, increasing its hardness or
giving it more hit points as well as an improved saving throw bonus
against <a href="spellsDtoE.html#disintegrate" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">disintegrate</a> and other similar
spells. A magic door might not lead into the space revealed beyond, but
instead it might be a portal to a faraway place or even another plane
of existence. Other magic doors might require passwords or special keys
to open them. </p>

      
      <a id="portcullises"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Portcullises:</span> These
special doors consist of iron or thick, ironbound, wooden shafts that
descend from a recess in the ceiling above an archway. Sometimes a
portcullis has crossbars that create a grid, sometimes not. Typically
raised by means of a winch or a capstan, a portcullis can be dropped
quickly, and the shafts end in spikes to discourage anyone from
standing underneath (or from attempting to dive under it as it drops).
Once it is dropped, a portcullis locks, unless it is so large that no
normal person could lift it anyway. In any event, lifting a typical
portcullis requires a DC 25 Strength check.<br />

      </p>

      
      <a id="walls-doors-and-detect-spells"></a><h5>WALLS, DOORS, AND DETECT SPELLS</h5>

Stone walls, iron walls, and iron doors are usually thick enough to
block most detect spells, such as <a href="spellsDtoE.html#detect-thoughts" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">detect thoughts</a>. Wooden walls,
wooden doors, and stone doors are usually not thick enough to do so.
However, a secret stone door built into a wall and as thick as the wall
itself (at least 1 foot) does block most detect spells.<br />

      
      <a id="rooms"></a><h5>ROOMS</h5>

Rooms in dungeons vary in shape and size. Although many are simple in
construction and appearance, particularly interesting rooms have
multiple levels joined by stairs, ramps, or ladders, as well as
statuary, altars, pits, chasms, bridges, and more.<br />

      
      <p>Underground chambers are prone to collapse, so many rooms-
particularly large ones-have arched ceilings or pillars to support the
weight of the rock overhead.</p>

      
      <p>Common dungeon rooms fall into the following broad categories.
      </p>

      
      <a id="guard-post"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Guard Post:</span>
Intelligent, social denizens of the dungeon will generally have a
series of adjacent rooms they consider &ldquo;theirs,&rdquo; and
they&rsquo;ll guard the
entrances to that common area. </p>

      
      <a id="living-quarters"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Living Quarters:</span> All
but the most nomadic creatures have a lair where they can rest, eat,
and store their treasure. Living quarters commonly include beds (if the
creature sleeps), possessions (both valuable and mundane), and some
sort of food preparation area. Noncombatant creatures such as juveniles
and the elderly are often found here.</p>

      
      <a id="work-area"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Area:</span> Most
intelligent creatures do more than just guard, eat, and sleep, and many
devote rooms to magic laboratories, workshops for weapons and armor, or
studios for more esoteric tasks.</p>

      
      <a id="shrine"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shrine:</span> Any creature
that is particularly religious may have some place dedicated to
worship, and others may venerate something of great historical or
personal value. Depending on the creature&rsquo;s resources and piety,
a
shrine can be humble or extensive. A shrine is where PCs will likely
encounter NPC clerics, and it&rsquo;s common for wounded monsters to
flee to
a shrine friendly to them when they seek healing.</p>

      
      <a id="vault"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vault:</span> Well protected,
often by a locked iron door, a vault is a special room that contains
treasure. There&rsquo;s usually only one entrance-an appropriate place
for a
trap.</p>

      
      <a id="crypt"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Crypt:</span> Although
sometimes constructed like a vault, a crypt can also be a series of
individual rooms, each with its own sarcophagus, or a long hall with
recesses on either side-shelves to hold coffins or bodies.</p>

      
      <p>Those who are worried about undead rising from the grave take
the precaution of locking and trapping a crypt from the outside- making
the crypt easy to get into but difficult to leave. Those worried about
tomb robbers make their crypts difficult to get into. Some builders do
both, just to be on the safe side.</p>

      
      <a id="corridors"></a><h5>CORRIDORS</h5>

All dungeons have rooms, and most have corridors. While most corridors
simply connect rooms, sometimes they can be encounter areas in their
own right because of traps, guard patrols, and wandering monsters out
on the hunt.<br />

      
      <a id="corridor-traps"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Corridor Traps:</span>
Because passageways in dungeons tend to be narrow, offering few
movement options, dungeon builders like to place traps in them. In a
cramped passageway, there&rsquo;s no way for intruders to move around
concealed pits, falling stones, arrow traps, tilting floors, and
sliding or rolling rocks that fill the entire passage. For the same
reason, magic traps such as <a href="spellsFtoG.html#glyph-of-warding" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">glyphs of warding</a> are effective
in hallways as well.</p>

      
      <a id="mazes"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mazes:</span> Usually,
passages connect chambers in the simplest and straightest manner
possible. Some dungeon builders, however, design a maze or a labyrinth
within the dungeon. This sort of construction is difficult to navigate
(or at least to navigate quickly) and, when filled with monsters or
traps, can be an effective barrier.</p>

      
      <p>A maze can be used to cut off one area of the dungeon,
deflecting intruders away from a protected spot. Generally, though, the
far side of a maze holds an important crypt or vault-someplace that the
dungeon&rsquo;s regular inhabitants rarely need to get to.<br />

      </p>

      
      <h5><a id="miscellaneous-features"></a>MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES</h5>

      <a id="stairs"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stairs:</span> The usual way to
connect different levels of a dungeon is with stairs. Straight
stairways, spiral staircases, or stairwells with multiple landings
between flights of stairs are all common in dungeons, as are ramps
(sometimes with an incline so slight that it can be difficult to
notice; <a href="skillsAll.html#spot" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Spot</a>
DC 15). Stairs are important accessways, and are sometimes guarded or
trapped. Traps on stairs often cause intruders to slide or fall down to
the bottom, where a pit, spikes, a pool of acid, or some other danger
awaits.<br />

      
      <a id="graudal-stairs"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Gradual Stairs:</span>
Stairs that rise less than 5 feet for every 5 feet of horizontal
distance they cover don&rsquo;t affect movement, but characters who
attack a
foe below them gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls from being on higher
ground. Most stairs in dungeons are gradual, except for spiral stairs
(see below).</p>

      
      <a id="steep-stairs"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Steep Stairs:</span>
Characters moving up steep stairs (which rise at a 45- degree angle or
steeper) must spend 2 squares of movement to enter each square of
stairs. Characters running or charging down steep stairs must succeed
on a DC 10 <a href="skillsAll.html#balance" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Balance</a> check upon entering the
first steep stairs square. Characters who fail stumble and must end
their movement 1d2&times;5 feet later. Characters who fail by 5 or more
take 1d6 points of damage and fall prone in the square where they end
their movement. Steep stairs increase the DC of <a href="skillsAll.html#tumble" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Tumble</a>
checks by 5.</p>

      
      <a id="spiral-stairs"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Spiral Stairs:</span> This
form of steep stairs is designed to make defending a fortress easier.
Characters gain cover against foes below them on spiral stairs because
they can easily duck around the staircase&rsquo;s central support.</p>


      <a id="railings-and-low-walls"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Railings and Low Walls:</span>
Stairs that are open to large rooms often have railings or low walls.
They function as described for ledges (see Special Floors).</p>

      
      <a id="bridge"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bridge:</span> A bridge
connects two higher areas separated by a lower area, stretching across
a chasm, over a river, or above a pit. A simple bridge might be a
single wooden plank, while an elaborate one could be made of mortared
stone with iron supports and side rails.</p>

      
      <a id="narrow-bridge"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Narrow Bridge:</span> If a
bridge is particularly narrow, such as a series of planks laid over
lava fissures, treat it as a ledge (see Special Floors). It requires a
Balance check (DC dependent on width) to cross such a bridge.</p>

      
      <a id="rope-bridge"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Rope Bridge:</span>
Constructed of wooden planks suspended from ropes, a rope bridge is
convenient because it&rsquo;s portable and can be easily removed. It
takes
two full-round actions to untie one end of a rope bridge, but a DC 15 <a href="skillsAll.html#use-rope" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Use
Rope</a> check reduces the time to a move action. If only one of the
two supporting ropes is attached, everyone on the bridge must succeed
on a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid falling off, and thereafter must make
DC 15 Climb checks to move along the remnants of the bridge. Rope
bridges are usually 5 feet wide. The two ropes that support them have 8
hit points each.</p>

      
      <a id="drawbridge"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Drawbridge:</span> Some
bridges have mechanisms that allow them to be extended or retracted
from the gap they cross. Typically,&nbsp; the winch mechanism exists on
only one side of the bridge. It takes a move action to lower a
drawbridge, but the bridge doesn&rsquo;t come down until the beginning
of the
lowering character&rsquo;s next turn. It takes a full-round action to
raise a
drawbridge; the drawbridge is up at the end of the action. Particularly
long or wide drawbridges may take more time to raise and lower, and
some may require Strength checks to rotate the winch.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Railings and Low Walls:</span>
Some bridges have railings or low walls along the sides. If a bridge
does, the railing or low walls affect Balance checks and bull rush
attempts as described for ledges (see Special Floors). Low walls
likewise provide cover to bridge occupants.</p>

      
      <a id="chutes-and-chimneys"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Chutes and Chimneys:</span>
Stairs aren&rsquo;t the only way to move up and down in a dungeon.
Sometimes
a vertical shaft connects levels of a dungeon or links a dungeon with
the surface. Chutes are usually traps that dump characters into a lower
area-often a place featuring some dangerous situation with which they
must contend.</p>

      
      <a id="pillar"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pillar:</span> A common sight
in any dungeon, pillars and columns give support to ceilings. The
larger the room, the more likely it has pillars. As a rule of thumb,
the deeper in the dungeon a room is, the thicker the pillars need to be
to support the overhead weight. Pillars tend to be polished and often
have carvings, paintings, or inscriptions upon them. </p>

      
      <a id="slender-pillar"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Slender Pillar:</span> These
pillars are only a foot or two across, so they don&rsquo;t occupy a
whole
square. A creature standing in the same square as a slender pillar
gains a +2 cover bonus to Armor Class and a +1 cover bonus on Reflex
saves (these bonuses don&rsquo;t stack with cover bonuses from other
sources). The presence of a slender pillar does not otherwise affect a
creature&rsquo;s fighting space, because it&rsquo;s assumed that the
creature is
using the pillar to its advantage when it can. A typical slender pillar
has AC 4, hardness 8, and 250 hit points.</p>

      
      <a id="wide-pillar"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Wide Pillar:</span> These
pillars take up an entire square and provide cover to anyone behind
them. They have AC 3, hardness 8, and 900 hit points. A DC 20 <a href="skillsAll.html#climb" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Climb</a>
check is sufficient to climb most pillars; the DC increases to 25 for
polished or unusually slick ones. </p>

      
      <a id="stalagmite-stalagtite"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stalagmite/Stalactite:</span>
These tapering natural rock columns extend from the floor (stalagmite)
or the ceiling (stalactite). Stalagmites and stalactites function as
slender pillars.</p>

      
      <a id="statue"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Statue:</span> Most statues
function as wide pillars, taking up a square and providing cover. Some
statues are smaller and act as slender pillars. A DC 15 Climb check
allows a character to climb a statue. </p>

      
      <a id="tapestry"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tapestry:</span> Elaborately
embroidered patterns or scenes on cloth, tapestries hang from the walls
of well-appointed dungeon rooms or corridors. Crafty builders take
advantage of tapestries to place alcoves, concealed doors, or secret
switches behind them.</p>

      
      <p>Tapestries provide total concealment (50% miss chance) to
characters behind them if they&rsquo;re hanging from the ceiling, or
concealment (20% miss chance) if they&rsquo;re flush with the wall.
Climbing
a big tapestry isn&rsquo;t particularly difficult, requiring a DC 15
Climb
check (or DC 10 if a wall is within reach).</p>

      
      <a id="pedestal"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pedestal:</span> Anything
important on display in a dungeon, from a fabulous treasure to a
coffin, tends to rest atop a pedestal or a dais. Raising the object off
the floor focuses attention on it (and, in practical terms, keeps it
safe from any water or other substance that might seep onto the floor).
A pedestal is often trapped to protect whatever sits atop it. It can
conceal a secret trapdoor beneath itself or provide a way to reach a
door in the ceiling above itself.</p>

      
      <p>Only the largest pedestals take up an entire square; most
provide no cover.</p>

      
      <a id="pool"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pool:</span> Pools of water
collect naturally in low spots in dungeons (a dry dungeon is rare).
Pools can also be wells or natural underground springs, or they can be
intentionally created basins, cisterns, and fountains. In any event,
water is fairly common in dungeons, harboring sightless fish and
sometimes aquatic monsters. Pools provide water for dungeon denizens,
and thus are as important an area for a predator to control as a
watering hole aboveground in the wild.</p>

      
      <a id="shallow-pool"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Shallow Pool:</span> If a
square contains a shallow pool, it has roughly 1 foot of standing
water. It costs 2 squares of movement to move into a square with a
shallow pool, and the DC of Tumble checks in such squares increases by
2.</p>

      
      <a id="deep-pool"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Deep Pool:</span> These
squares have at least 4 feet of standing water. It costs Medium or
larger creatures 4 squares of movement to move into a square with a
deep pool, or characters can swim if they wish. Small or smaller
creatures must swim to move through a square containing a deep pool.
Tumbling is impossible in a deep pool. The water in a deep pool
provides cover for Medium or larger creatures. Smaller creatures gain
improved cover (+8 bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves). Medium or
larger creatures can crouch as a move action to gain this improved
cover. Creatures with this improved cover take a -10 penalty on attacks
against creatures that aren&rsquo;t also underwater. </p>

      
      <p>Deep pool squares are usually clustered together and
surrounded by a ring of shallow pool squares. Both shallow pools and
deep pools impose a -2 circumstance penalty on <a href="skillsAll.html#move-silently" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Move
Silently</a> checks.</p>

      
      <a id="special-pools"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Special Pools:</span>
Through accident or design, a pool can become magically enhanced.
Rarely, a pool or a fountain may be found that has the ability to
bestow beneficial magic on those who drink from it. However, magic
pools are just as likely to curse the drinker. Typically, water from a
magic pool loses its potency if removed from the pool for more than an
hour or so.</p>

      
      <p>Some pools have fountains. Occasionally these are merely
decorative, but they often serve as the focus of a trap or the source
of a pool&rsquo;s magic.</p>

      
      <p>Most pools are made of water, but anything&rsquo;s possible in
a
dungeon. Pools can hold unsavory substances such as blood, poison, oil,
or magma. And even if a pool holds water, it can be holy water,
saltwater, or water tainted with disease.</p>

      
      <a id="elevator"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Elevator:</span> In place of
or in addition to stairs, an elevator (essentially an oversized
dumbwaiter) can take inhabitants from one dungeon level to the next.
Such an elevator may be mechanical (using gears, pulleys, and winches)
or magical (such as a <a href="spellsHtoL.html#levitate" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">levitate</a> spell cast on a movable
flat surface). A mechanical elevator might be as small as a platform
that holds one character at a time, or as large as an entire room that
raises and lowers. A clever builder might design an elevator room that
moves up or down without the occupants&rsquo; knowledge to catch them
in a
trap, or one that appears to have moved when it actually remained
still. </p>

      
      <p>A typical elevator ascends or descends 10 feet per round at
the beginning of the operator&rsquo;s turn (or on initiative count 0 if
it
functions without regard to whether creatures are on it. Elevators can
be enclosed, can have railings or low walls, or may simply be
treacherous floating platforms.</p>

      
      <a id="ladders"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ladders:</span> Whether
free-standing or rungs set into a wall, a ladder requires a DC 0 Climb
check to ascend or descend.</p>

      
      <a id="shifting-stone-or-wall"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shifting Stone or Wall:</span>
These features can cut off access to a passage or room, trapping
adventurers in a dead end or preventing escape out of the dungeon.
Shifting walls can force explorers to go down a dangerous path or
prevent them from entering a special area. Not all shifting walls need
be traps. For example, stones controlled by pressure plates,
counterweights, or a secret lever can shift out of a wall to become a
staircase leading to a hidden upper room or secret ledge.</p>

      
      <p>Shifting stones and walls are generally constructed as traps
with triggers and <a href="skillsAll.html#search" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Search</a> and <a href="skillsAll.html#disable-device" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Disable
Device</a> DCs. However they don&rsquo;t have Challenge Ratings because
they&rsquo;re inconveniences, not deadly in and of themselves.</p>

      
      <a id="teleporters"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Teleporters:</span> Sometimes
useful, sometimes devious, places in a dungeon rigged with a
teleportation effect (such as a <a href="spellsTtoZ.html#teleportation-circle" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">teleportation circle</a>) transport
characters to some other location in the dungeon or someplace far away.
They can be traps, teleporting the unwary into dangerous situations, or
they can be an easy mode of transport for those who built or live in
the dungeon, good for bypassing barriers and traps or simply to get
around more quickly. Devious dungeon designers might place a teleporter
in a room that transports characters to another seemingly identical
room so that they don&rsquo;t even know they&rsquo;ve been teleported.
A <a href="spellsDtoE.html#detect-magic" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">detect
magic</a> spell will provide a clue to the presence of a teleporter,
but direct experimentation or other research is the only way to
discover where the teleporter leads.</p>

      
      <a id="altars"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Altars:</span>
Temples-particularly to dark gods-often exist underground. Usually
taking the form of a stone block, an altar is the main fixture and
central focus of such a temple. Sometimes all the other trappings of
the temple are long gone, lost to theft, age, and decay, but the altar
survives. Some altars have traps or powerful magic within them. Most
take up one or two squares on the grid and provide cover to creatures
behind them.<br />

      </p>

      
      <a id="collapses"></a><h6><a id="cave-ins"></a>Cave-Ins and Collapses (CR 8)</h6>

Cave-ins and collapsing tunnels are extremely dangerous. Not only do
dungeon explorers face the danger of being crushed by tons of falling
rock, even if they survive they may be buried beneath a pile of rubble
or cut off from the only known exit. A cave-in buries anyone in the
middle of the collapsing area, and then sliding debris damages anyone
in the periphery of the collapse. A typical corridor subject to a
cave-in might have a bury zone with a 15-foot radius and a
10-foot-radius slide zone extending beyond the bury zone. A weakened
ceiling can be spotted with a DC 20 <a href="skillsAll.html#knowledge" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Knowledge </a>(architecture and
engineering) or DC 20 <a href="skillsAll.html#craft" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Craft</a> (stonemasonry) check.
Remember that Craft checks can be made untrained as Intelligence
checks. A dwarf can make such a check if he simply passes within 10
feet of a weakened ceiling.
      
      <p>A weakened ceiling may collapse when subjected to a major
impact or concussion. A character can cause a cave-in by destroying
half the pillars holding the ceiling up. </p>

      
      <p>Characters in the bury zone of a cave-in take 8d6 points of
damage, or half that amount if they make a DC 15 Reflex save. They are
subsequently buried. Characters in the slide zone take 3d6 points of
damage, or no damage at all if they make a DC 15 Reflex save.
Characters in the slide zone who fail their saves are buried.</p>

      
      <p>Characters take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute
while buried. If such a character falls unconscious, he must make a DC
15 Constitution check. If it fails, he takes 1d6 points of lethal
damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.</p>

      
      <p>Characters who aren&rsquo;t buried can dig out their friends.
In 1
minute, using only her hands, a character can clear rocks and debris
equal to five times her heavy load limit. The amount of loose stone
that fills a 5-foot-by-5-foot area weighs one ton (2,000 pounds). Armed
with an appropriate tool, such as a pick, crowbar, or shovel, a digger

      <a id="slimes-molds-and-fungi"></a><h6>Slimes, Molds, and Fungi</h6>

In a dungeon&rsquo;s damp, dark recesses, molds and fungi thrive. While
some
plants and fungi are monsters and other slime, mold, and fungus is just
normal, innocuous stuff, a few varieties are dangerous dungeon
encounters. For purposes of spells and other special effects, all
slimes, molds, and fungi are treated as plants. Like traps, dangerous
slimes and molds have CRs, and characters earn XP for encountering
them.
      
      <p>A form of glistening organic sludge coats almost anything that
remains in the damp and dark for too long. This kind of slime, though
it might be repulsive, is not dangerous.</p>

      
      <p>Molds and fungi flourish in dark, cool, damp places. While
some are as inoffensive as the normal dungeon slime, others are quite
dangerous. Mushrooms, puffballs, yeasts, mildew, and other sorts of
bulbous, fibrous, or flat patches of fungi can be found throughout most
dungeons. They are usually inoffensive, and some are even edible
(though most are unappealing or odd-tasting).</p>

      
      <a id="green-slime"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Green Slime (CR 4):</span>
This dungeon peril is a dangerous variety of normal slime. Green slime
devours flesh and organic materials on contact and is even capable of
dissolving metal. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls,
floors, and ceilings in patches, reproducing as it consumes organic
matter. It drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement (and
possible food) below.</p>

      
      <p>A single 5-foot square of green slime deals 1d6 points of
Constitution damage per round while it devours flesh. On the first
round of contact, the slime can be scraped off a creature (most likely
destroying the scraping device), but after that it must be frozen,
burned, or cut away (dealing damage to the victim as well). Anything
that deals cold or fire damage, sunlight, or a <a href="spellsPtoR.html#remove-disease" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">remove
disease</a> spell destroys a patch of green slime. Against wood or
metal, green slime deals 2d6 points of damage per round, ignoring
metal&rsquo;s hardness but not that of wood. It does not harm stone.</p>

      
      <a id="yellow-mold"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yellow Mold (CR 6):</span> If
disturbed, a 5-foot square of this mold bursts forth with a cloud of
poisonous spores. All within 10 feet of the mold must make a DC 15
Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage. Another DC 15
Fortitude save is required 1 minute later-even by those who succeeded
on the first save-to avoid taking 2d6 points of Constitution damage.
Fire destroys yellow mold, and sunlight renders it dormant.</p>

      
      <a id="brown-mold"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Brown Mold (CR 2):</span>
Brown mold feeds on warmth, drawing heat from anything around it. It
normally comes in patches 5 feet in diameter, and the temperature is
always cold in a 30-foot radius around it. Living creatures within 5
feet of it take 3d6 points of nonlethal cold damage. Fire brought
within 5 feet of brown mold causes it to instantly double in size. Cold
damage, such as from a <a href="spellsC.html#cone-of-cold" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">cone of cold</a>, instantly destroys
it.</p>

      
      <a id="phosphorescent-fungus"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Phosphorescent Fungus (No CR):</span>
This strange underground fungus grows in clumps that look almost like
stunted shrubbery. Drow elves cultivate it for food and light. It gives
off a soft violet glow that illuminates underground caverns and
passages as well as a candle does. Rare patches of fungus illuminate as
well as a torch does.</p>

      <a id="forest-trees"></a><p><b>Trees</b>: The most important terrain element in a forest
is the trees, obviously. A creature standing in the same square as a
tree gains a +2 bonus to Armor Class and a +1 bonus on Reflex saves
(these bonuses don&rsquo;t stack with cover bonuses from other
sources). The
presence of a tree doesn&rsquo;t otherwise affect a creature&rsquo;s
fighting
space, because it&rsquo;s assumed that the creature is using the tree
to its
advantage when it can. The trunk of a typical tree has AC 4, hardness
5, and 150 hp. A DC 15 <a href="skillsAll.html#climb" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Climb</a> check is sufficient to
climb a tree.</p>

      
      <p>Medium and dense forests have massive trees as well. These
trees take up an entire square and provide cover to anyone behind them.
They have AC 3, hardness 5, and 600 hp. Like their smaller
counterparts, it takes a DC 15 Climb check to climb them.</p>

      
      <a id="forest-undergrowth"></a><p><b>Undergrowth</b>: Vines, roots, and short bushes cover much
of the ground in a forest. A space covered with light undergrowth costs
2 squares of movement to move into, and it provides concealment.
Undergrowth increases the DC of <a href="skillsAll.html#tumble" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Tumble</a> and <a href="skillsAll.html#move-silently" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Move
Silently</a> checks by 2
because the leaves and branches get in the way.</p>

      
      <p>Heavy undergrowth costs 4 squares of movement to move into,
and it provides concealment with a 30% miss chance (instead of the
usual 20%). It increases the DC of Tumble and Move Silently checks by
5. Heavy undergrowth is easy to hide in, granting a +5 circumstance
bonus on <a href="skillsAll.html#hide" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Hide</a> checks. Running and
charging are impossible. Squares with
undergrowth are often clustered together. Undergrowth and trees
aren&rsquo;t
mutually exclusive; it&rsquo;s common for a 5-foot square to have both
a tree
and undergrowth.</p>

      
      <a id="forest-canopy"></a><p><b>Forest Canopy</b>: It&rsquo;s common for elves and other
forest
dwellers to live on raised platforms far above the surface floor. These
wooden platforms generally have rope bridges between them. To get to
the treehouses, characters generally ascend the trees&rsquo; branches (<a href="skillsAll.html#climb" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Climb</a>
DC 15), use rope ladders (Climb DC 0), or take pulley elevators (which
can be made to rise a number of feet equal to a Strength check, made
each round as a full-round action). Creatures on platforms or branches
in a forest canopy are considered to have cover when fighting creatures
on the ground, and in medium or dense forests they have concealment as
well.</p>

      
      <a id="other-forest-terrain-elements"></a><p><b>Other Forest Terrain Elements</b>: Fallen logs generally
stand about 3 feet high and provide cover just as low walls do. They
cost 5 feet of movement to cross. Forest streams are generally 5 to 10
feet wide and no more than 5 feet deep. Pathways wind through most
forests, allowing normal movement and providing neither cover nor
concealment. These paths are less common in dense forests, but even
unexplored forests will have occasional game trails.</p>

      
      <a id="stealth-and-detection-in-a-forest"></a><p><b>Stealth and Detection in a Forest</b>: In a sparse forest,
the maximum distance at which a <a href="skillsAll.html#spot" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Spot</a> check for detecting the
nearby
presence of others can succeed is 3d6&times;10 feet. In a medium
forest, this distance is 2d8&times;10 feet, and in a dense forest it is
2d6&times;10 feet.</p>

      
      <p>Because any square with undergrowth provides concealment,
it&rsquo;s
usually easy for a creature to use the Hide skill in the forest. Logs
and massive trees provide cover, which also makes hiding possible.</p>

      
      <p>The background noise in the forest makes <a href="skillsAll.html#listen" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Listen</a>
checks more
difficult, increasing the DC of the check by 2 per 10 feet, not 1 (but
note that Move Silently is also more difficult in undergrowth). </p>

      
      <h6><a id="forest-fires"></a>Forest Fires (CR 6)</h6>

      
      <p class="initial">Most campfire sparks ignite nothing, but if
conditions are dry, winds are strong, or the forest floor is dried out
and flammable, a forest fire can result. Lightning strikes often set
trees afire and start forest fires in this way. Whatever the cause of
the fire, travelers can get caught in the conflagration.</p>

      
      <p>A forest fire can be spotted from as far away as 2d6&times;100
feet by a character who makes a <a href="skillsAll.html#spot" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Spot</a> check, treating the fire as
a
Colossal creature (reducing the DC by 16). If all characters fail their
Spot checks, the fire moves closer to them. They automatically see it
when it closes to half the original distance.</p>

      
      <p>Characters who are <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#blinded" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">blinded</a> or otherwise unable to
make Spot
checks can feel the heat of the fire (and thus automatically
&ldquo;spot&rdquo; it)
when it is 100 feet away.</p>

      
      <p>The leading edge of a fire (the downwind side) can advance
faster than a human can run (assume 120 feet per round for winds of
moderate strength). Once a particular portion of the forest is ablaze,
it remains so for 2d4&times;10 minutes before dying to a smoking
smolder. Characters overtaken by a forest fire may find the leading
edge of the fire advancing away from them faster than they can keep up,
trapping them deeper and deeper in its grasp.</p>

      
      <p>Within the bounds of a forest fire, a character faces three
dangers: heat damage, catching on fire, and smoke inhalation. </p>

      
      <a id="forest-fire-heat-damage"></a><p><b>Heat Damage</b>: Getting caught within a forest fire is
even worse than being exposed to extreme heat (see Heat Dangers).
Breathing the air causes a character to take 1d6 points of damage per
round (no save). In addition, a character must make a Fortitude save
every 5 rounds (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of
nonlethal damage. A character who holds his breath can avoid the lethal
damage, but not the nonlethal damage. Those wearing heavy clothing or
any sort of armor take a &ndash;4 penalty on their saving throws. In
addition, those wearing metal armor or coming into contact with very
hot metal are affected as if by a heat metal spell.</p>

      
      <a id="forest-fire-catching-on-fire"></a><p><b>Catching on Fire</b>: Characters engulfed in a forest fire
are at risk of catching on fire when the leading edge of the fire
overtakes them, and are then at risk once per minute thereafter (see
Catching on Fire).</p>

      
      <a id="forest-fire-smoke-inhalation"></a><p><b>Smoke Inhalation</b>: Forest fires naturally produce a
great deal of smoke. A character who breathes heavy smoke must make a
Fortitude save each round (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or spend that
round choking and coughing. A character who chokes for 2 consecutive
rounds takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Also, smoke obscures
vision, providing concealment to characters within it.</p>

      <p>A square that is part of a deep bog has roughly 4 feet of

      <p>The water in a deep bog provides cover for Medium or larger
creatures. Smaller creatures gain improved cover (+8 bonus to AC, +4
bonus on Reflex saves). Medium or larger creatures can crouch as a move
action to gain this improved cover. Creatures with this improved cover
take a &ndash;10 penalty on attacks against creatures that aren&rsquo;t

      <h6><a id="avalanches"></a>Avalanches (CR 7)</h6>

      
      <p class="initial">The combination of high peaks and heavy
snowfalls means that avalanches are a deadly peril in many mountainous
areas. While avalanches of snow and ice are common, it&rsquo;s also
possible
to have an avalanche of rock and soil.</p>

      
      <p>An avalanche can be spotted from as far away as 1d10&times;500
feet downslope by a character who makes a DC 20 <a href="skillsAll.html#spot" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Spot</a>
check, treating
the avalanche as a Colossal creature. If all characters fail their Spot
checks to determine the encounter distance, the avalanche moves closer
to them, and they automatically become aware of it when it closes to
half the original distance.</p>

      
      <p>It&rsquo;s possible to hear an avalanche coming even if you
can&rsquo;t
see it. Under optimum conditions (no other loud noises occurring), a
character who makes a DC 15 <a href="skillsAll.html#listen" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Listen</a> check can hear the
avalanche or
landslide when it is 1d6&times;500 feet away. This check might have a
DC of 20, 25, or higher in conditions where hearing is difficult (such
as in the middle of a thunderstorm). </p>

      
      <p>A landslide or avalanche consists of two distinct areas: the
bury zone (in the direct path of the falling debris) and the slide zone
(the area the debris spreads out to encompass). Characters in the bury
zone always take damage from the avalanche; characters in the slide
zone may be able to get out of the way.</p>

      
      <p>Characters in the bury zone take 8d6 points of damage, or half
that amount if they make a DC 15 Reflex save. They are subsequently
buried (see below).</p>

      
      <p>Characters in the slide zone take 3d6 points of damage, or no
damage if they make a DC 15 Reflex save. Those who fail their saves are
buried. </p>

      
      <p>Buried characters take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per
minute. If a buried character falls <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">unconscious</a>, he or she must make
a
DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each
minute thereafter until freed or <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#dead" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">dead</a>.</p>

      
      <p>The typical avalanche has a width of 1d6&times;100 feet, from
one edge of the slide zone to the opposite edge. The bury zone in the
center of the avalanche is half as wide as the avalanche&rsquo;s full
width.
To determine the precise location of characters in the path of an
avalanche, roll 1d6&times;20; the result is the number of feet from the
center of the path taken by the bury zone to the center of the
party&rsquo;s
location. Avalanches of snow and ice advance at a speed of 500 feet per
round, and rock avalanches travel at a speed of 250 feet per round.</p>

possible altitude bands: low pass, low peak/high pass, and high peak. </p>

      
      <a id="low-pass"></a><p><i>Low Pass (lower than 5,000 feet)</i>: Most travel in low
mountains takes place in low passes, a zone consisting largely of
alpine meadows and forests. Travelers may find the going difficult
(which is reflected in the movement modifiers for traveling through
mountains), but the altitude itself has no game effect.</p>

      
      <a id="low-peak-or-high-pass"></a><p><i>Low Peak or High Pass (5,000 to 15,000 feet)</i>: Ascending
to the highest slopes of low mountains, or most normal travel through
high mountains, falls into this category. All nonacclimated creatures
labor to breathe in the thin air at this altitude. Characters must
succeed on a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or
be <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#fatigued" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">fatigued</a>. The fatigue ends when
the character descends to an
altitude with more air.</p>

      
      <p>Acclimated characters do not have to attempt the Fortitude
save. </p>

      
      <a id="high-peak"></a><p><i>High Peak (more than 15,000 feet)</i>: The highest
mountains exceed 20,000 feet in height. At these elevations, creatures
are subject to both high altitude fatigue (as described above) and
altitude sickness, whether or not they&rsquo;re acclimated to high
altitudes.</p>

      
      <a id="altitude-sickness"></a><p>Altitude sickness represents long-term oxygen deprivation, and
it affects mental and physical ability scores. After each 6-hour period
a character spends at an altitude of over 15,000 feet, he must succeed
on a Fortitude save (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1 point of
damage to all ability scores.</p>

      
      <p>Creatures acclimated to high altitude receive a +4 competence
bonus on their saving throws to resist high altitude effects and
altitude sickness, but eventually even seasoned mountaineers must
abandon these dangerous elevations. </p>

      
      <h5><a id="desert"></a>DESERT TERRAIN</h5>

      
      <p class="initial">Desert terrain exists in warm, temperate, and
cold climates, but all deserts share one common trait: little rain. The
three categories of desert terrain are tundra (cold deserts), rocky
desert (often temperate), and sandy desert (often warm).</p>

      
      <p>Tundra differs from the other desert categories in two
important ways. Because snow and ice cover much of the landscape,
it&rsquo;s
easy to find water. And during the height of summer, the permafrost
thaws to a depth of a foot or so, turning the landscape into a vast
field of mud. The muddy tundra affects movement and skill use as the
shallow bogs described in marsh terrain, although there&rsquo;s little
standing water.</p>

      </table>

      
      <p>The table above describes terrain elements found in each of
the three desert categories. The terrain elements on this table are
mutually exclusive; for instance, a square of tundra may contain either
light undergrowth or an ice sheet, but not both.</p>

      
      <a id="desert-light-undergrowth"></a><p><b>Light Undergrowth</b>: Consisting of scrubby, hardy bushes
and cacti, light undergrowth functions as described for other terrain
types.</p>

      
      <a id="desert-ice-sheet"></a><p><b>Ice Sheet</b>: The ground is covered with slippery ice. It
costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square covered by an ice sheet,
and the DC of <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#balance">Balance</a> and Tumble
checks there increases by 5. A DC 10
Balance check is required to run or <a href="specialAttacks.html#charge" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">charge</a>
across an ice sheet. </p>

      
      <a id="desert-light-rubble"></a><p><b>Light Rubble</b>: Small rocks are strewn across the ground,
making nimble movement more difficult more difficult. The DC of Balance
and <a href="skillsAll.html#tumble" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Tumble</a>
checks increases by 2. </p>

      
      <a id="desert-dense-rubble"></a><p><b>Dense Rubble</b>: This terrain feature consists of more and
larger stones. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square with
dense rubble. The DC of Balance and Tumble checks increases by 5, and
the DC of <a href="skillsAll.html#move-silently" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Move Silently</a> checks increases
by 2.</p>

      
      <a id="desert-sand-dunes"></a><p><b>Sand Dunes</b>: Created by the action of wind on sand, sand
dunes function as hills that move. If the wind is strong and
consistent, a sand dune can move several hundred feet in a week&rsquo;s
time.
Sand dunes can cover hundreds of squares. They always have a gentle
slope pointing in the direction of the prevailing wind and a steep
slope on the leeward side.</p>

      
      <a id="other-desert-terrain-features"></a><p><b>Other Desert Terrain Features</b>: Tundra is sometimes
bordered by forests, and the occasional tree isn&rsquo;t out of place
in the
cold wastes. Rocky deserts have towers and mesas consisting of flat
ground surrounded on all sides by cliffs and steep slopes (described in
Mountain Terrain, above). Sandy deserts sometimes have quicksand; this
functions as described in Marsh Terrain, above, although desert
quicksand is a waterless mixture of fine sand and dust. All desert
terrain is crisscrossed with dry streambeds (treat as trenches 5 to 15
feet wide) that fill with water on the rare occasions when rain falls.</p>

      
      <a id="stealth-and-detection-in-the-desert"></a><p><b>Stealth and Detection in the Desert</b>: In general, the
maximum distance in desert terrain at which a <a href="skillsAll.html#spot" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Spot</a>
check for detecting
the nearby presence of others can succeed is 6d6&times;20 feet; beyond
this distance, elevation changes and heat distortion in warm deserts
makes spotting impossible. The presence of dunes in sandy deserts
limits spotting distance to 6d6&times;10 feet. </p>

      
      <p>The desert imposes neither bonuses nor penalties on <a href="skillsAll.html#listen" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Listen</a>
or
Spot checks. The scarcity of undergrowth or other elements that offer
concealment or cover makes hiding more difficult.</p>

      
      <a id="sandstorms"></a><h6>Sandstorms</h6>

      
      <p class="initial">A sandstorm reduces visibility to 1d10&times;5
feet and provides a &ndash;4 penalty on Listen, Search, and Spot
checks. A
sandstorm deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage per hour to any
creatures caught in the open, and leaves a thin coating of sand in its
wake. Driving sand creeps in through all but the most secure seals and
seams, to chafe skin and contaminate carried gear. </p>

      
      <h5><a id="plains"></a>PLAINS TERRAIN</h5>

      
      <p class="initial">Plains come in three categories: farms,
grasslands, and battlefields. Farms are common in settled areas, of
course, while grasslands represent untamed plains. The battlefields
where large armies clash are temporary places, usually reclaimed by
natural vegetation or the farmer&rsquo;s plow. Battlefields represent a
third
terrain category because adventurers tend to spend a lot of time there,
not because they&rsquo;re particularly prevalent.</p>

      
      <p>The table below shows the proportions of terrain elements in
the different categories of plains. On a farm, light undergrowth
represents most mature grain crops, so farms growing vegetable crops
will have less light undergrowth, as will all farms during the time
between harvest and a few months after planting.</p>

      </table>

      
      <a id="plains-undergrowth"></a><p><b>Undergrowth</b>: Whether they&rsquo;re crops or natural
vegetation, the tall grasses of the plains function like light
undergrowth in a forest. Particularly thick bushes form patches of
heavy undergrowth that dot the landscape in grasslands.</p>

      
      <a id="plains-light-rubble"></a><p><b>Light Rubble</b>: On the battlefield, light rubble usually
represents something that was destroyed: the ruins of a building or the
scattered remnants of a stone wall, for example. It functions as
described in the desert terrain section above.</p>

      
      <a id="plains-trench"></a><p><b>Trench</b>: Often dug before a battle to protect soldiers,
a trench functions as a low wall, except that it provides no cover
against adjacent foes. It costs 2 squares of movement to leave a
trench, but it costs nothing extra to enter one. Creatures outside a
trench who make a melee attack against a creature inside the trench
gain a +1 bonus on melee attacks because they have higher ground.</p>

      
      <p>In farm terrain, trenches are generally irrigation ditches.</p>

      
      <a id="plains-berm"></a><p><b>Berm</b>: A common defensive structure, a berm is a low,
earthen wall that slows movement and provides a measure of cover. Put a
berm on the map by drawing two adjacent rows of steep slope (described
in Hills Terrain, above), with the edges of the berm on the downhill
side. Thus, a character crossing a two-square berm will travel uphill
for 1 square, then downhill for 1 square. Two square berms provide
cover as low walls for anyone standing behind them. Larger berms
provide the low wall benefit for anyone standing 1 square downhill from
the top of the berm. </p>

      
      <a id="plains-fences"></a><p><b>Fences</b>: Wooden fences are generally used to contain
livestock or impede oncoming soldiers. It costs an extra square of
movement to cross a wooden fence. A stone fence provides a measure of
cover as well, functioning as low walls. Mounted characters can cross a
fence without slowing their movement if they succeed on a DC 15 <a href="skillsAll.html#ride" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Ride</a>
check. If the check fails, the steed crosses the fence, but the rider
falls out of the saddle.</p>

      
      <a id="other-plains-terrain-features"></a><p><b>Other Plains Terrain Features</b>: Occasional trees dot the
landscape in many plains, although on battlefields they&rsquo;re often
felled
to provide raw material for siege engines (described in Urban
Features). Hedgerows (described in Marsh Terrain) are found in plains
as well. Streams, generally 5 to 20 feet wide and 5 to 10 feet deep,
are commonplace.</p>

      
      <a id="stealth-and-detection-in-plains"></a><p><b>Stealth and Detection in Plains</b>: In plains terrain, the
maximum distance at which a Spot check for detecting the nearby
presence of others can succeed is 6d6&times;40 feet, although the
specifics of your map may restrict line of sight.</p>

      
      <p>Plains terrain provides no bonuses or penalties on <a href="skillsAll.html#listen" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Listen</a>
and <a href="skillsAll.html#spot" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Spot</a>
checks. Cover and concealment are not uncommon, so a good place of
refuge is often nearby, if not right at hand.</p>

      
      <h5><a id="aquatic"></a>AQUATIC TERRAIN</h5>

      
      <p class="initial">Aquatic terrain is the least hospitable to
most PCs, because they can&rsquo;t breathe there. Aquatic terrain
doesn&rsquo;t
offer the variety that land terrain does. The ocean floor holds many
marvels, including undersea analogues of any of the terrain elements
described earlier in this section. But if characters find themselves in
the water because they were <a href="specialAttacks.html#bull-rush" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">bull rushed</a> off the deck of a
pirate ship,
the tall kelp beds hundreds of feet below them don&rsquo;t matter.</p>

      
      <p>Accordingly, these rules simply divide aquatic terrain into
two categories: flowing water (such as streams and rivers) and
nonflowing water (such as lakes and oceans).</p>

      
      <a id="flowing-water"></a><p><b>Flowing Water</b>: Large, placid rivers move at only a few
miles per hour, so they function as still water for most purposes. But
some rivers and streams are swifter; anything floating in them moves
downstream at a speed of 10 to 40 feet per round. The fastest rapids
send swimmers bobbing downstream at 60 to 90 feet per round. Fast
rivers are always at least rough water (<a href="skillsAll.html#swim" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Swim</a> DC 15), and whitewater
rapids are stormy water (Swim DC 20).</p>

      
      <p>If a character is in moving water, move her downstream the
indicated distance at the end of her turn. A character trying to
maintain her position relative to the riverbank can spend some or all
of her turn swimming upstream.</p>

      
      <a id="swept-away"></a><p><i>Swept Away</i>: Characters swept away by a river moving 60
feet per round or faster must make DC 20 Swim checks every round to
avoid going under. If a character gets a check result of 5 or more over
the minimum necessary, he arrests his motion by catching a rock, tree
limb, or bottom snag&mdash;he is no longer being carried along by the
flow of
the water. Escaping the rapids by reaching the bank requires three DC
20 Swim checks in a row. Characters arrested by a rock, limb, or snag
can&rsquo;t escape under their own power unless they strike out into
the
water and attempt to swim their way clear. Other characters can rescue
them as if they were trapped in quicksand (described in Marsh Terrain,
above). </p>

      
      <a id="nonflowing-water"></a><p><b>Nonflowing Water</b>: Lakes and oceans simply require a
swim speed or successful Swim checks to move through (DC 10 in calm
water, DC 15 in rough water, DC 20 in stormy water). Characters need a
way to breathe if they&rsquo;re underwater; failing that, they risk
drowning.
When underwater, characters can move in any direction as if they were
flying with perfect maneuverability.</p>

      
      <a id="stealth-and-detection-underwater"></a><p><b>Stealth and Detection Underwater</b>: How far you can see
underwater depends on the water&rsquo;s clarity. As a guideline,
creatures
can see 4d8&times;10 feet if the water is clear, and 1d8&times;10 feet
if it&rsquo;s murky. Moving water is always murky, unless it&rsquo;s in
a
particularly large, slow-moving river.</p>

      
      <p>It&rsquo;s hard to find cover or concealment to hide
underwater
(except along the seafloor). <a href="skillsAll.html#listen" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Listen</a> and <a href="skillsAll.html#move-silently" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Move
Silently</a> checks function
normally underwater.</p>

      
      <a id="invisibility-underwater"></a><p><i>Invisibility</i>: An <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#invisible" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">invisible</a> creature displaces
water and
leaves a visible, body-shaped &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; where the water was
displaced.
The creature still has concealment (20% miss chance), but not total
concealment (50% miss chance).</p>

      
      <a id="undewater-combat"></a><h6>Underwater Combat</h6>

      
      <p class="initial">Land-based creatures can have considerable
difficulty when fighting in water. Water affects a creature&rsquo;s
Armor
Class, attack rolls, damage, and movement. In some cases a
creature&rsquo;s
opponents may get a bonus on attacks. The effects are summarized in the
accompanying table. They apply whenever a character is swimming,
walking in chestdeep water, or walking along the bottom. </p>

      
      <a id="ranged-attacks-underwater"></a><p><b>Ranged Attacks Underwater</b>: Thrown weapons are
ineffective underwater, even when launched from land. Attacks with
other ranged weapons take a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls for every
5 feet
of water they pass through, in addition to the normal penalties for
range. </p>

      
      <a id="attacks-from-land"></a><p><b>Attacks from Land</b>: Characters swimming, floating, or
treading water on the surface, or wading in water at least chest deep,
have improved cover (+8 bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves) from
opponents on land. Landbound opponents who have freedom of movement
effects ignore this cover when making melee attacks against targets in
the water. A completely submerged creature has total cover against
opponents on land unless those opponents have freedom of movement
effects. Magical effects are unaffected except for those that require
attack rolls (which are treated like any other effects) and fire
effects.</p>

      
      <a id="fire-underwater"></a><p><b>Fire</b>: Nonmagical fire (including alchemist&rsquo;s
fire) does
not burn underwater. Spells or spell-like effects with the fire
descriptor are ineffective underwater unless the caster makes a <a href="skillsAll.html#spellcraft" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Spellcraft</a>
check (DC 20 + spell
level). If the check succeeds, the
spell creates a bubble of steam instead of its usual fiery effect, but
otherwise the spell works as described. A supernatural fire effect is
ineffective underwater unless its description states otherwise.</p>

      
      <p>The surface of a body of water blocks line of effect for any
fire spell. If the caster has made a Spellcraft check to make the fire
spell usable underwater, the surface still blocks the spell&rsquo;s
line of
effect.</p>

      <p>At
first glance, a city is much like a dungeon, made up of walls, doors,
rooms, and corridors. Adventures that take place in cities have two
salient differences from their dungeon counterparts, however.
Characters have greater access to resources, and they must contend with
law enforcement.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a id="access-to-resources"></a>Access to Resources:</span>
Unlike in dungeons and the wilderness, characters can buy and sell gear
quickly in a city. A large city or metropolis probably has high-level
NPCs and experts in obscure fields of knowledge who can provide
assistance and decipher clues. And when the PCs are battered and
bruised, they can retreat to the comfort of a room at the inn.</p>
      <p>The
freedom to retreat and ready access to the marketplace means that the
players have a greater degree of control over the pacing of an urban
adventure.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a id="law-enforcement"></a>Law Enforcement:</span>
The other key distinctions between adventuring in a city and delving
into a dungeon is that a dungeon is, almost by definition, a lawless
place where the only law is that of the jungle: Kill or be killed. A
city, on the other hand, is held together by a code of laws, many of
which are explicitly designed to prevent the sort of behavior that
adventurers engage in all the time: killing and looting. Even so, most
cities&rsquo; laws recognize monsters as a threat to the stability the city
relies on, and prohibitions about murder rarely apply to monsters such
as aberrations or evil outsiders. Most evil humanoids, however, are
typically protected by the same laws that protect all the citizens of
the city. Having an evil alignment is not a crime (except in some
severely theocratic cities, perhaps, with the magical power to back up
the law); only evil deeds are against the law. Even when adventurers
encounter an evildoer in the act of perpetrating some heinous evil upon
the populace of the city, the law tends to frown on the sort of
vigilante justice that leaves the evildoer dead or otherwise unable to
testify at a trial.</p>
      <h6><a id="weapon-and-spell-restrictions"></a>Weapon And Spell Restrictions</h6>
Different cities have different laws about such issues as carrying weapons in public and restricting spellcasters.
      <p>The
city&rsquo;s laws may not affect all characters equally. A monk isn&rsquo;t
hampered at all by a law about peace-bonding weapons, but a cleric is
reduced to a fraction of his power if all holy symbols are confiscated
at the city&rsquo;s gates.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h5><a id="urban-features"></a>URBAN FEATURES</h5>
Walls, doors,
poor lighting, and uneven footing: In many ways a city is much like a
dungeon. Some new considerations for an urban setting are covered below.
      <h6><a id="walls-and-gates"></a>Walls and Gates</h6>
Many
cities are surrounded by walls. A typical small city wall is a
fortified stone wall 5 feet thick and 20 feet high. Such a wall is
fairly smooth, requiring a DC 30 <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="skillsAll.html#climb">Climb</a> check to scale. The walls are
crenellated on one side to provide a low wall for the guards atop it,
and there is just barely room for guards to walk along the top of the
wall. A typical small city wall has AC 3, hardness 8, and 450 hp per
10-foot section.
      <p>A typical large city wall is 10 feet thick and 30
feet high, with crenellations on both sides for the guards on top of
the wall. It is likewise smooth, requiring a DC 30&nbsp;<a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="skillsAll.html#climb">Climb</a> check to
scale. Such a wall has AC 3, hardness 8, and 720 hp per 10-foot section.</p>
      <p>A
typical metropolis wall is 15 feet thick and 40 feet tall. It has
crenellations on both sides and often has a tunnel and small rooms
running through its interior. Metropolis walls have AC 3, hardness 8,
and 1,170 hp per 10- foot section.</p>
      <p>Unlike smaller cities,
metropolises often have interior walls as well as surrounding
walls-either old walls that the city has outgrown, or walls dividing
individual districts from each other. Sometimes these walls are as
large and thick as the outer walls, but more often they have the
characteristics of a large city&rsquo;s or small city&rsquo;s walls.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a id="watch-towers"></a>Watch Towers:</span>
Some city walls are adorned with watch towers set at irregular
intervals. Few cities have enough guards to keep someone constantly
stationed at every tower, unless the city is expecting attack from
outside. The towers provide a superior view of the surrounding
countryside as well as a point of defense against invaders.<br />
Watch
towers are typically 10 feet higher than the wall they adjoin, and
their diameter is 5 times the thickness of the wall. <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="#walls-with-arrow-slits">Arrow slits</a> line
the outer sides of the upper stories of a tower, and the top is
crenellated like the surrounding walls are. In a small tower (25 feet
in diameter adjoining a 5-foot-thick wall), a simple ladder typically
connect the tower&rsquo;s stories and the roof. In a larger tower, stairs
serve that purpose.<br />
Heavy wooden doors, reinforced with iron and
bearing good locks (<a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="skillsAll.html#open-lock">Open Lock</a> DC 30), block entry to a tower, unless
the tower is in regular use. As a rule, the captain of the guard keeps
the key to the tower secured on her person, and a second copy is in the
city&rsquo;s inner fortress or barracks.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a id="gates"></a>Gates:</span>
A typical city gate is a gatehouse with two portcullises and murder
holes above the space between them. In towns and some small cities, the
primary entry is through iron double doors set into the city wall.<br />
Gates
are usually open during the day and locked or barred at night. Usually,
one gate lets in travelers after sunset and is staffed by guards who
will open it for someone who seems honest, presents proper papers, or
offers a large enough bribe (depending on the city and the guards).</p>
      <h6><a id="guards-and-soldiers"></a>Guards and Soldiers</h6>
A
city typically has full-time military personnel equal to 1% of its
adult population, in addition to militia or conscript soldiers equal to
5% of the population. The full-time soldiers are city guards
responsible for maintaining order within the city, similar to the role
of modern police, and (to a lesser extent) for defending the city from
outside assault. Conscript soldiers are called up to serve in case of
an attack on the city.
      <p>A typical city guard force works on three
eight-hour shifts, with 30% of the force on a day shift (8 A.M. to 4
P.M.), 35% on an evening shift (4 P.M. to 12 A.M.), and 35% on a night
shift (12 A.M. to 8 A.M.). At any given time, 80% of the guards on duty
are on the streets patrolling, while the remaining 20% are stationed at
various posts throughout the city, where they can respond to nearby
alarms. At least one such guard post is present within each
neighborhood of a city (each neighborhood consisting of several
districts).</p>
      <p>The majority of a city guard force is made up of
      <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="npcClasses.html#warrior">warriors</a>, mostly 1st level. Officers include higher-level warriors,
fighters, a fair number of clerics, and wizards or sorcerers, as well
as multiclass fighter/spellcasters.</p>
      <h6><a id="siege-engines"></a>Siege Engines</h6>
Siege
engines are large weapons, temporary structures, or pieces of equipment
traditionally used in besieging a castle or fortress.<br />

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a id="catapult-heavy"></a>Catapult, Heavy:</span>
A heavy catapult is a massive engine capable of throwing rocks or heavy
objects with great force. Because the catapult throws its payload in a
high arc, it can hit squares out of its line of sight. To fire a heavy
catapult, the crew chief makes a special check against DC 15 using only
his base attack bonus, Intelligence modifier, range increment penalty,
and the appropriate modifiers from the lower section of Table: Siege Engines . If
the check succeeds, the catapult stone hits the square the catapult was
aimed at, dealing the indicated damage to any object or character in
the square. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save take half
damage. Once a catapult stone hits a square, subsequent shots hit the
same square unless the catapult is reaimed or the wind changes
direction or speed.</p>
      <p>If a catapult stone misses, roll 1d8 to
determine where it lands. This determines the misdirection of the
throw, with 1 being back toward the catapult and 2 through 8 counting
clockwise around the target square. Then, count 3 squares away from the
target square for every range increment of the attack.</p>
      <p>Loading a
catapult requires a series of full-round actions. It takes a DC 15
Strength check to winch the throwing arm down; most catapults have
wheels to allow up to two crew members to use the <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="specialAttacks.html#aid-another">aid another</a> action,
assisting the main winch operator. A DC 15 <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="skillsAll.html#profession">Profession</a> (siege engineer)
check latches the arm into place, and then another DC 15 Profession
(siege engineer) check loads the catapult ammunition. It takes four
full-round actions to reaim a heavy catapult (multiple crew members can
perform these full-round actions in the same round, so it would take a
crew of four only 1 round to reaim the catapult).</p>
      <p>A heavy catapult takes up a space 15 feet across.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a id="catapult-light"></a>Catapult, Light:</span>
This is a smaller, lighter version of the heavy catapult. It functions
as the heavy catapult, except that it takes a DC 10 Strength check to
winch the arm into place, and only two full-round actions are required
to reaim the catapult.</p>
      <p>A light catapult takes up a space 10 feet across.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a id="ballista"></a>Ballista:</span>
A ballista is essentially a Huge heavy crossbow fixed in place. Its
size makes it hard for most creatures to aim it. Thus, a Medium
creature takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls when using a ballista, and
a Small creature takes a -6 penalty. It takes a creature smaller than
Large two full-round actions to reload the ballista after firing.</p>
      <p>A ballista takes up a space 5 feet across.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a id="ram"></a>Ram:</span>
This heavy pole is sometimes suspended from a movable scaffold that
allows the crew to swing it back and forth against objects. As a
full-round action, the character&nbsp;closest to the front of the ram makes
an attack roll against the AC of the construction, applying the -4
penalty for lack of proficiency. (It&rsquo;s not possible to be proficient
with this device.) In addition to the damage given on Table: Siege
Engines, up to nine other characters holding the ram can add their
Strength modifier to the ram&rsquo;s damage, if they devote an attack action
to doing so. It takes at least one Huge or larger creature, two Large
creatures, four Medium-size creatures, or eight Small creatures to
swing a ram. (Tiny or smaller creatures can&rsquo;t use a ram.)</p>
      <p>A ram
is typically 30 feet long. In a battle, the creatures wielding the ram
stand in two adjacent columns of equal length, with the ram between
them.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a id="siege-tower"></a>Siege Tower:</span> This
device is a massive wooden tower on wheels or rollers that can be
rolled up against a wall to allow attackers to scale the tower and thus
to get to the top of the wall with cover. The wooden walls are usually
1 foot thick.</p>
      <p>A typical siege tower takes up a space 15 feet
across. The creatures inside push it at a speed of 10 feet (and a siege
tower can&rsquo;t run). The eight creatures pushing on the ground floor have
total cover, and those on higher floors get improved cover and can fire
through arrow slits.</p>
      <h6><a id="city-streets"></a>City Streets</h6>
Typical city streets are
narrow and twisting. Most streets average 15 to 20 feet wide [(1d4+1)&times;5
feet)], while alleys range from 10 feet wide to only 5 feet.
Cobblestones in good condition allow normal movement, but ones in poor
repair and heavily rutted dirt streets are considered light rubble,
increasing the DC of <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="skillsAll.html#balance">Balance</a> and <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="skillsAll.html#tumble">Tumble</a> checks by 2.
      <p>Some cities have
no larger thoroughfares, particularly cities that gradually grew from
small settlements to larger cities. Cities that are planned, or perhaps
have suffered a major fire that allowed authorities to construct new
roads through formerly inhabited areas, might have a few larger streets
through town. These main roads are 25 feet wide-offering room for
wagons to pass each other-with 5-foot-wide sidewalks on either side.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a id="crowds"></a>Crowds:</span>
Urban streets are often full of people going about their daily lives.
In most cases, it isn&rsquo;t necessary to put every 1st-level commoner on
the map when a fight breaks out on the city&rsquo;s main thoroughfare.
Instead just indicate which squares on the map contain crowds. If
crowds see something obviously dangerous, they&rsquo;ll move away at 30 feet
per round at initiative count 0. It takes 2 squares of movement to
enter a square with crowds. The crowds provide cover for anyone who
does so, enabling a <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="skillsAll.html#hide">Hide</a> check and providing a bonus to Armor Class and
on Reflex saves.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;"><a id="directing-crowds"></a>Directing Crowds:</span>
It takes a DC 15 <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="skillsAll.html#diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> check or DC 20 <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="skillsAll.html#intimidate">Intimidate</a> check to convince
a crowd to move in a particular direction, and the crowd must be able
to hear or see the character making the attempt. It takes a full-round
action to make the Diplomacy check, but only a free action to make the
Intimidate check.</p>
      <p>If two or more characters are trying to direct
a crowd in different directions, they make opposed Diplomacy or
Intimidate checks to determine whom the crowd listens to. The crowd
ignores everyone if none of the characters&rsquo; check results beat the DCs
given above.</p>

Getting to a roof usually requires climbing a wall (see the Walls
section), unless the character can reach a roof by jumping down from a
higher window, balcony, or bridge. Flat roofs, common only in warm
climates (accumulated snow can cause a flat roof to collapse), are easy
to run across. Moving along the peak of a roof requires a DC 20 <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="skillsAll.html#balance">Balance</a>
check. Moving on an angled roof surface without changing altitude
(moving parallel to the peak, in other words) requires a DC 15 Balance
check. Moving up and down across the peak of a roof requires a DC 10
Balance check.
      <p>Eventually a character runs out of roof, requiring a
long jump across to the next roof or down to the ground. The distance
to the next closest roof is usually 1d3&times;5 feet horizontally, but the
roof across the gap is equally likely to be 5 feet higher, 5 feet
lower, or the same height. Use the guidelines in the <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="skillsAll.html#jump">Jump</a> skill (a
horizontal jump&rsquo;s peak height is one-fourth of the horizontal distance)
to determine whether a character can make a jump.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a id="sewers"></a>Sewers:</span>
To get into the sewers, most characters open a grate (a full-round
action) and jump down 10 feet. Sewers are built exactly like dungeons,
except that they&rsquo;re much more likely to have floors that are slippery
or covered with water. Sewers are also similar to dungeons in terms of
creatures liable to be encountered therein. Some cities were built atop
the ruins of older civilizations, so their sewers sometimes lead to
treasures and dangers from a bygone age.</p>
      <h6><a id="city-buildings"></a>City Buildings</h6>
Most
city buildings fall into three categories. The majority of buildings in
the city are two to five stories high, built side by side to form long
rows separated by secondary or main streets. These row houses usually
have businesses on the ground floor, with offices or apartments above.
      <p>Inns,
successful businesses, and large warehouses - as well as millers,
tanners, and other businesses that require extra space - are generally
large, free-standing buildings with up to five stories. </p>
      <p>Finally,
small residences, shops, warehouses, or storage sheds are simple,
one-story wooden buildings, especially if they&rsquo;re in poorer
neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>Most city buildings are made of a combination of
stone or clay brick (on the lower one or two stories) and timbers (for
the upper stories, interior walls, and floors). Roofs are a mixture of
boards, thatch, and slates, sealed with pitch. A typical lower-story
wall is 1 foot thick, with AC 3, hardness 8, 90 hp, and a <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="skillsAll.html#climb">Climb</a> DC of
25. Upper-story walls are 6 inches thick, with AC 3, hardness 5, 60 hp,
and a Climb DC of 21. Exterior doors on most buildings are good wooden
doors that are usually kept locked, except on public buildings such as
shops and taverns.</p>
      <h6><a id="bying-buildings"></a>Buying Buildings</h6>
Characters might want to buy their own buildings or even construct their
own castle. Use the prices in Table: Buildings directly, or as a guide
when for extrapolating costs for more exotic structures.<br />

If
a city has main thoroughfares, they are lined with lanterns hanging at
a height of 7 feet from building awnings. These lanterns are spaced 60
feet apart, so their illumination is all but continuous. Secondary
streets and alleys are not lit; it is common for citizens to hire
lantern-bearers when going out after dark.

Table: Wind Effects for possible consequences to creatures caught
outside without shelter during such a storm. Storms are divided into
the following three types. </p>

      
      <a id="duststorm"></a><p><i>Duststorm (CR 3)</i>: These desert storms differ from other
storms in that they have no precipitation. Instead, a duststorm blows
fine grains of sand that obscure vision, smother unprotected flames,
and can even choke protected flames (50% chance). Most duststorms are
accompanied by severe winds and leave behind a deposit of 1d6 inches of
sand. However, there is a 10% chance for a greater duststorm to be
accompanied by windstorm-magnitude winds (see Table: Wind Effects).
These greater duststorms deal 1d3 points of nonlethal damage each round
to anyone caught out in the open without shelter and also pose a
choking hazard (see Drowning&mdash;except that a character with a scarf
or
similar protection across her mouth and nose does not begin to choke
until after a number of rounds equal to 10 &times; her Constitution
score). Greater duststorms leave 2d3&ndash;1 feet of fine sand in their
wake.</p>

      
      <a id="snowstorm"></a><p><i>Snowstorm</i>: In addition to the wind and precipitation
common to other storms, snowstorms leave 1d6 inches of snow on the
ground afterward. </p>

      
      <a id="thunderstorm"></a><p><i>Thunderstorm</i>: In addition to wind and precipitation
(usually rain, but sometimes also hail), thunderstorms are accompanied
by lightning that can pose a hazard to characters without proper
shelter (especially those in metal armor). As a rule of thumb, assume
one bolt per minute for a 1-hour period at the center of the storm.
Each bolt causes electricity damage equal to 1d10 eight-sided dice. One
in ten thunderstorms is accompanied by a tornado (see below). </p>

      
      <p><a id="powerful-storms"></a><b>Powerful Storms</b>: Very high winds and torrential
precipitation reduce visibility to zero, making Spot, Search, and
Listen checks and all ranged weapon attacks impossible. Unprotected
flames are automatically extinguished, and protected flames have a 75%
chance of being doused. Creatures caught in the area must make a DC 20
Fortitude save or face the effects based on the size of the creature
(see Table: Wind Effects). Powerful storms are divided into the</p>

      
      <p>following four types.</p>

      
      <p><i>Windstorm</i>: While accompanied by little or no
precipitation, windstorms can cause considerable damage simply through
the force of their wind.</p>

      
      <a id="blizzard"></a><p><i>Blizzard</i>: The combination of high winds, heavy snow
(typically 1d3 feet), and bitter cold make blizzards deadly for all who
are unprepared for them.</p>

      
      <a id="hurricane"></a><p><i>Hurricane</i>: In addition to very high winds and heavy
rain, hurricanes are accompanied by floods. Most adventuring activity
is impossible under such conditions.</p>

      
      <a id="tornado"></a><p><i>Tornado</i>: One in ten thunderstorms is accompanied by a
tornado.</p>

      
      <a id="fog"></a><h6>Fog</h6>

      
      <p class="initial">Whether in the form of a low-lying cloud or a
mist rising from the ground, fog obscures all sight, including
darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment
(attacks by or against them have a 20% miss chance).</p>

      
      <a id="winds"></a><h6>Winds</h6>

      
      <p class="initial">The wind can create a stinging spray of sand
or dust, fan a large fire, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or
vapors away. If powerful enough, it can even knock characters down (see
Table: Wind Effects), interfere with ranged attacks, or impose
penalties on some skill checks.</p>

      
      <a id="light-wind"></a><p><i>Light Wind</i>: A gentle breeze, having little or no game
effect.</p>

extinguishing small, unprotected flames, such as candles.</p>

      
      <a id="strong-wind"></a><p><i>Strong Wind</i>: Gusts that automatically extinguish
unprotected flames (candles, torches, and the like). Such gusts impose
a &ndash;2 penalty on ranged attack rolls and on Listen checks.</p>

      
      <a id="severe-wind"></a><p><i>Severe Wind</i>: In addition to automatically extinguishing
any unprotected flames, winds of this magnitude cause protected flames
(such as those of lanterns) to dance wildly and have a 50% chance of
extinguishing these lights. Ranged weapon attacks and Listen checks are
at a &ndash;4 penalty. This is the velocity of wind produced by a

      <a id="windstorm"></a><p><i>Windstorm</i>: Powerful enough to bring down branches if
not whole trees, windstorms automatically extinguish unprotected flames
and have a 75% chance of blowing out protected flames, such as those of
lanterns. Ranged weapon attacks are impossible, and even siege weapons
have a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls. Listen checks are at a

Ranged attacks are impossible (except with siege weapons, which have a
&ndash;8 penalty on attack rolls). Listen checks are impossible: All
characters can hear is the roaring of the wind. Hurricane-force winds
often fell trees.</p>

      
      <a id="tornado-cr-10"></a><p><i>Tornado (CR 10)</i>: All flames are extinguished. All

checks. Instead of being <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#blown-away" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">blown away</a> (see Table: Wind
Effects),
characters in close proximity to a tornado who fail their Fortitude
saves are sucked toward the tornado. Those who come in contact with the
actual funnel cloud are picked up and whirled around for 1d10 rounds,
taking 6d6 points of damage per round, before being violently expelled
(falling damage may apply). While a tornado&rsquo;s rotational speed
can be
as great as 300 mph, the funnel itself moves forward at an average of
30 mph (roughly 250 feet per round). A tornado uproots trees, destroys
buildings, and causes other similar forms of major destruction.</p>

      <a id="acid-effects"></a><h5>ACID EFFECTS</h5>

      
      <p class="initial">Corrosive acids deals 1d6 points of damage per
round of exposure except in the case of total immersion (such as into a
vat of acid), which deals 10d6 points of damage per round. An attack

counts as
a round of exposure.</p>

      
      <p>The fumes from most acids are inhaled poisons. Those who come
close enough to a large body of acid to dunk a creature in it must make
a DC 13 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Constitution damage. All such
characters must make a second save 1 minute later or take another 1d4
points of Constitution damage.</p>

      
      <p>Creatures immune to acid&rsquo;s caustic properties might
still
drown in it if they are totally immersed (see Drowning).</p>

      
      <h5><a id="cold-dangers"></a>COLD DANGERS</h5>

      
      <p class="initial">Cold and exposure deal nonlethal damage to the
victim. This nonlethal damage cannot be recovered until the character
gets out of the cold and warms up again. Once a character is rendered <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">unconscious</a> through the
accumulation of nonlethal damage, the cold and
exposure begins to deal lethal damage at the same rate.</p>

      
      <p>An unprotected character in cold weather (below 40&deg; F)
must make a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, + 1 per previous check) or
take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. A character who has the <a href="skillsAll.html#survival" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Survival</a>
skill may receive a bonus on this saving throw and may be able to apply
this bonus to other characters as well (see the skill Description).</p>

      
      <p>In conditions of severe cold or exposure (below 0&deg; F), an
unprotected character must make a Fortitude save once every 10 minutes
(DC 15, +1 per previous check), taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage
on each failed save. A character who has the Survival skill may receive
a bonus on this saving throw and may be able to apply this bonus to
other characters as well (see the skill description). Characters
wearing winter clothing only need check once per hour for cold and
exposure damage.</p>

      
      <p>A character who takes any nonlethal damage from cold or
exposure is beset by frostbite or hypothermia (treat her as <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#fatigued" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">fatigued</a>).
These penalties end when the character recovers the nonlethal damage
she took from the cold and exposure.</p>

      
      <p>Extreme cold (below &ndash;20&deg; F) deals 1d6 points of
lethal
damage per minute (no save). In addition, a character must make a
Fortitude save (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of
nonlethal damage. Those wearing metal armor or coming into contact with
very cold metal are affected as if by a chill metal spell.</p>

      
      <a id="ice-effects"></a><h6>Ice Effects</h6>

      
      <p class="initial">Characters walking on ice must spend 2 squares

      <a id="darkness"></a><h5>DARKNESS</h5>

      
      <p class="initial">Darkvision allows many characters and monsters
to see perfectly well without any light at all, but characters with
normal vision (or low-light vision, for that matter) can be rendered
completely <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#blinded" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">blind</a> by putting out the lights.
Torches or lanterns can be
blown out by sudden gusts of subterranean wind, magical light sources
can be dispelled or countered, or magical traps might create fields of
impenetrable darkness.</p>

      
      <p>In many cases, some characters or monsters might be able to
see, while others are blinded. For purposes of the following points, a
blinded creature is one who simply can&rsquo;t see through the
surrounding
darkness.</p>

      
      <p>&mdash;Creatures blinded by darkness lose the ability to deal
extra
damage due to precision (for example, a ranger&rsquo;s favored enemy or
a
sneak attack).</p>

      
      <p>&mdash;Blinded creatures are hampered in their movement, and
pay 2
squares of movement per square moved into (double normal cost). Blinded
creatures can&rsquo;t run or <a href="specialAttacks.html#charge" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">charge</a>.</p>

      
      <p>&mdash;All opponents have total concealment from a blinded
creature,
so the blinded creature has a 50% miss chance in combat. A blinded
creature must first pinpoint the location of an opponent in order to
attack the right square; if the blinded creature launches an attack
without pinpointing its foe, it attacks a random square within its
reach. For ranged attacks or spells against a foe whose location is not
pinpointed, roll to determine which adjacent square the blinded
creature is facing; its attack is directed at the closest target that
lies in that direction.</p>

      
      <p>&mdash;A blinded creature loses its Dexterity adjustment to AC
and
takes a &ndash;2 penalty to AC.</p>

      
      <p>&mdash;A blinded creature takes a &ndash;4 penalty on <a href="skillsAll.html#search" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Search</a>
checks and
most Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks, including any with an
armor check penalty. A creature blinded by darkness automatically fails
any skill check relying on vision.</p>

      
      <p>&mdash;Creatures blinded by darkness cannot use gaze attacks
and are
immune to gaze attacks.</p>

      
      <p>A creature blinded by darkness can make a <a href="skillsAll.html#listen" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Listen</a>
check as a
free action each round in order to locate foes (DC equal to
opponents&rsquo; <a href="skillsAll.html#move-silently" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Move
Silently</a> checks). A
successful check lets a blinded character hear
an unseen creature &ldquo;over there somewhere.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s
almost impossible to
pinpoint the location of an unseen creature. A Listen check that beats
the DC by 20 reveals the unseen creature&rsquo;s square (but the unseen
creature still has total concealment from the blinded creature).</p>

      
      <p>&mdash;A blinded creature can grope about to find unseen
creatures.
A character can make a touch attack with his hands or a weapon into two
adjacent squares using a standard action. If an unseen target is in the
designated square, there is a 50% miss chance on the touch attack. If
successful, the groping character deals no damage but has pinpointed
the unseen creature&rsquo;s current location. (If the unseen creature
moves,
its location is once again unknown.)</p>

      
      <p>&mdash;If a blinded creature is struck by an unseen foe, the
blinded
character pinpoints the location of the creature that struck him (until
the unseen creature moves, of course). The only exception is if the
unseen creature has a reach greater than 5 feet (in which case the
blinded character knows the location of the unseen opponent, but has
not pinpointed him) or uses a ranged attack (in which case, the blinded
character knows the general direction of the foe, but not his location).</p>

      
      <p>&mdash;A creature with the scent ability automatically
pinpoints
unseen creatures within 5 feet of its location.</p>

      
      <a id="falling"></a><h5>FALLING</h5>

      
      <a id="falling-damage"></a><p class="initial"><b>Falling Damage</b>: The basic rule is
simple: 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d6.</p>

      
      <p>If a character deliberately jumps instead of merely slipping
or falling, the damage is the same but the first 1d6 is nonlethal
damage. A DC 15 <a href="skillsAll.html#jump" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Jump</a> check or DC 15 <a href="skillsAll.html#tumble" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Tumble</a>
check allows the character
to avoid any damage from the first 10 feet fallen and converts any
damage from the second 10 feet to nonlethal damage. Thus, a character
who slips from a ledge 30 feet up takes 3d6 damage. If the same
character deliberately jumped, he takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage
and 2d6 points of lethal damage. And if the character leaps down with a
successful Jump or Tumble check, he takes only 1d6 points of nonlethal
damage and 1d6 points of lethal damage from the plunge.</p>

      
      <p>Falls onto yielding surfaces (soft ground, mud) also convert
the first 1d6 of damage to nonlethal damage. This reduction is
cumulative with reduced damage due to deliberate jumps and the Jump
skill.</p>

      
      <a id="falling-into-water"></a><p><b>Falling into Water</b>: Falls into water are handled
somewhat differently. If the water is at least 10 feet deep, the first
20 feet of falling do no damage. The next 20 feet do nonlethal damage
(1d3 per 10-foot increment). Beyond that, falling damage is lethal
damage (1d6 per additional 10-foot increment).</p>

      
      <p>Characters who deliberately dive into water take no damage on
a successful DC 15 <a href="skillsAll.html#swim" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Swim</a> check or DC 15 Tumble
check, so long as the
water is at least 10 feet deep for every 30 feet fallen. However, the
DC of the check increases by 5 for every 50 feet of the dive. </p>

      
      <a id="falling-objects"></a><h5>FALLING OBJECTS</h5>

      
      <p class="initial">Just as characters take damage when they fall
more than 10 feet, so too do they take damage when they are hit by
falling objects.</p>

      
      <p>Objects that fall upon characters deal damage based on their
weight and the distance they have fallen.</p>

      
      <p>For each 200 pounds of an object&rsquo;s weight, the object
deals
1d6 points of damage, provided it falls at least 10 feet. Distance also
comes into play, adding an additional 1d6 points of damage for every
10-foot increment it falls beyond the first (to a maximum of 20d6
points of damage).</p>

      
      <p>Objects smaller than 200 pounds also deal damage when dropped,
but they must fall farther to deal the same damage. Use Table: Damage
from Falling Objects to see how far an object of a given weight must
drop to deal 1d6 points of damage.</p>

      <h5><a id="heat-dangers"></a>HEAT DANGERS</h5>

      
      <p class="initial">Heat deals nonlethal damage that cannot be
recovered until the character gets cooled off (reaches shade, survives
until nightfall, gets doused in water, is targeted by endure elements,
and so forth). Once rendered <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">unconscious</a> through the
accumulation of
nonlethal damage, the character begins to take lethal damage at the
same rate.</p>

      
      <p>A character in very hot conditions (above 90&deg; F) must make
a Fortitude saving throw each hour (DC 15, +1 for each previous check)
or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Characters wearing heavy
clothing or armor of any sort take a &ndash;4 penalty on their saves. A
character with the <a href="skillsAll.html#survival" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Survival</a> skill may receive a
bonus on this saving
throw and may be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well
(see the skill description). Characters reduced to unconsciousness
begin taking lethal damage (1d4 points per hour).</p>

      
      <p>In severe heat (above 110&deg; F), a character must make a
Fortitude save once every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 for each previous
check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Characters wearing heavy
clothing or armor of any sort take a &ndash;4 penalty on their saves. A
character with the Survival skill may receive a bonus on this saving
throw and may be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well.
Characters reduced to unconsciousness begin taking lethal damage (1d4
points per each 10-minute period).</p>

      
      <p>A character who takes any nonlethal damage from heat exposure
now suffers from heatstroke and is <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#fatigued" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">fatigued</a>. These penalties end
when
the character recovers the nonlethal damage she took from the heat.</p>

      
      <p>Extreme heat (air temperature over 140&deg; F, fire, boiling
water, lava) deals lethal damage. Breathing air in these temperatures
deals 1d6 points of damage per minute (no save). In addition, a
character must make a Fortitude save every 5 minutes (DC 15, +1 per
previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Those wearing
heavy clothing or any sort of armor take a &ndash;4 penalty on their
saves.
In addition, those wearing metal armor or coming into contact with very
hot metal are affected as if by a <a href="spellsHtoL.html#heat-metal" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">heat metal</a> spell.</p>

      
      <p>Boiling water deals 1d6 points of scalding damage, unless the
character is fully immersed, in which case it deals 10d6 points of
damage per round of exposure.</p>

      
      <a id="catching-on-fire"></a><h6>Catching on Fire</h6>

      
      <p class="initial">Characters exposed to burning oil, bonfires,
and noninstantaneous magic fires might find their clothes, hair, or
equipment on fire. Spells with an instantaneous duration don&rsquo;t
normally
set a character on fire, since the heat and flame from these come and
go in a flash.</p>

      
      <p>Characters at risk of catching fire are allowed a DC 15 Reflex
save to avoid this fate. If a character&rsquo;s clothes or hair catch
fire,
he takes 1d6 points of damage immediately. In each subsequent round,
the burning character must make another Reflex saving throw. Failure
means he takes another 1d6 points of damage that round. Success means
that the fire has gone out. (That is, once he succeeds on his saving
throw, he&rsquo;s no longer on fire.)</p>

      
      <p>A character on fire may automatically extinguish the flames by
jumping into enough water to douse himself. If no body of water is at
hand, rolling on the ground or smothering the fire with cloaks or the
like permits the character another save with a +4 bonus.</p>

      
      <p>Those unlucky enough to have their clothes or equipment catch
fire must make DC 15 Reflex saves for each item. Flammable items that
fail take the same amount of damage as the character.</p>

      
      <a id="lava-effects"></a><h6>Lava Effects</h6>

      
      <p class="initial">Lava or magma deals 2d6 points of damage per
round of exposure, except in the case of total immersion (such as when
a character falls into the crater of an active volcano), which deals
20d6 points of damage per round.</p>

      
      <p>Damage from magma continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure
ceases, but this additional damage is only half of that dealt during
actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 10d6 points per round).</p>

      
      <p>An immunity or resistance to fire serves as an immunity to
lava or magma. However, a creature immune to fire might still drown if
completely immersed in lava (see Drowning, below).</p>

      
      <a id="smoke-effects"></a><h5>SMOKE EFFECTS</h5>

      
      <p class="initial">A character who breathes heavy smoke must make
a Fortitude save each round (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or spend
that round choking and coughing. A character who chokes for 2
consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage.</p>

      
      <p>Smoke obscures vision, giving concealment (20% miss chance) to
characters within it.</p>

      
      <a id="starvation-and-thirst"></a><h5>STARVATION AND THIRST</h5>

      
      <p class="initial">Characters might find themselves without food
or water and with no means to obtain them. In normal climates, Medium
characters need at least a gallon of fluids and about a pound of decent
food per day to avoid starvation. (Small characters need half as much.)
In very hot climates, characters need two or three times as much water
to avoid dehydration.</p>

      
      <p>A character can go without water for 1 day plus a number of
hours equal to his Constitution score. After this time, the character
must make a Constitution check each hour (DC 10, +1 for each previous
check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage.</p>

      
      <p>A character can go without food for 3 days, in growing
discomfort. After this time, the character must make a Constitution
check each day (DC 10, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points
of nonlethal damage.</p>

      
      <p>Characters who have taken nonlethal damage from lack of food
or water are <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#fatigued" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">fatigued</a>. Nonlethal damage from
thirst or starvation
cannot be recovered until the character gets food or water, as
needed&mdash;not even magic that restores hit points heals this damage.</p>

      
      <h5><a id="suffocation"></a>SUFFOCATION</h5>

      
      <p class="initial">A character who has no air to breathe can hold
her breath for 2 rounds per point of Constitution. After this period of
time, the character must make a DC 10 Constitution check in order to
continue holding her breath. The save must be repeated each round, with
the DC increasing by +1 for each previous success.</p>

      
      <p>When the character fails one of these Constitution checks, she
begins to suffocate. In the first round, she falls <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">unconscious</a> (0 hit
points). In the following round, she drops to &ndash;1 hit points and
is <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#dying" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">dying</a>. In the third round, she
suffocates.</p>

      
      <a id="slow-suffocation"></a><p><b>Slow Suffocation</b>: A Medium character can breathe easily
for 6 hours in a sealed chamber measuring 10 feet on a side. After that
time, the character takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage every 15
minutes. Each additional Medium character or significant fire source (a
torch, for example) proportionally reduces the time the air will last.
When a character falls unconscious from this nonlethal damage, she
drops to &ndash;1 hit points and is dying. In the next round, she
suffocates.<br />

      </p>

      
      <p>Small characters consume half as much air as Medium
characters. A larger volume of air, of course, lasts for a longer time.
      </p>

      
      <h5><a id="water-dangers"></a>WATER DANGERS</h5>

      
      <p class="initial">Any character can wade in relatively calm
water that isn&rsquo;t over his head, no check required. Similarly,
swimming
in calm water only requires skill checks with a DC of 10. Trained
swimmers can just take 10. (Remember, however, that armor or heavy gear
makes any attempt at swimming much more difficult. See the <a href="skillsAll.html#swim" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Swim</a>
skill
description.)</p>

      
      <p>By contrast, fast-moving water is much more dangerous. On a
successful DC 15 Swim check or a DC 15 Strength check, it deals 1d3
points of nonlethal damage per round (1d6 points of lethal damage if
flowing over rocks and cascades). On a failed check, the character must
make another check that round to avoid going under.</p>

      
      <p>Very deep water is not only generally pitch black, posing a
navigational hazard, but worse, it deals water pressure damage of 1d6
points per minute for every 100 feet the character is below the
surface. A successful Fortitude save (DC 15, +1 for each previous
check) means the diver takes no damage in that minute.</p>

      
      <p>Very cold water deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from
hypothermia per minute of exposure.</p>

      
      <h6><a id="drowning"></a>Drowning</h6>

      
      <p class="initial">Any character can hold her breath for a number
of rounds equal to twice her Constitution score. After this period of
time, the character must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round in
order to continue holding her breath. Each round, the DC increases by
1. </p>

      
      <p>When the character finally fails her Constitution check, she
begins to drown. In the first round, she falls <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">unconscious</a> (0 hp). In
the following round, she drops to &ndash;1 hit points and is <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#dying" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">dying</a>. In the
third round, she drowns.</p>

      
      <p>It is possible to drown in substances other than water, such
as sand, quicksand, fine dust, and silos full of grain.</p>
