      The d20 game�s hit point system is an easy and effective way of measuring
      character health � but it�s somewhat abstract. This variant eliminates hit
      points, and simply determines whether characters are hurt or killed every
      time they�re hit in combat.
    <h5><a id="determining-injuries"></a>
      DETERMINING INJURIES
    </h5>
      When using the injury variant, characters no longer have hit points.
      Instead, a character�s injuries accumulate until he becomes <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#disabled">disabled</a> or
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying">dying</a> (or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#staggered">staggered</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#unconscious">unconscious</a>, if he has taken nonlethal damage).
    <p>
      When a character or creature takes damage, divide the damage dealt by the
      attack by 5 (rounding up). The result is the damage value of the attack.
      For example, if you are hit by an attack that deals 12 points of damage,
      the attack has a damage value of 3 (12 divided by 5, rounded up).
    </p>
    <p>
      To determine if you are injured, make a Fortitude save to resist
      injury. The DC is 15 + the damage value.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you succeed on the save, you suffer no ill effect from the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you fail the save by less than 10, you have taken a hit. (If the attack
      dealt nonlethal damage, the hit is a nonlethal hit.) Each hit you take
      imposes a cumulative -1 modifier on future Fortitude saves to resist
      injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you fail the save by 10 or more, you are <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#disabled">disabled</a>. (If the attack dealt
      nonlethal damage, you are <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#staggered">staggered</a>.)
    </p>

    <p><b><a id="automatic-success-and-failure"></a>Automatic Success and Failure:</b>
      A natural 20 on a Fortitude save to resist
      injury is treated as an automatic success, just as normal. A natural 1 is
      always treated as if the save failed by 10 or more.

      CONDITION DESCRIPTIONS
    </h5>
      Use the descriptions below to determine the game effects from a failed
      saving throw to resist injury.

    <h6><a id="hit"></a>Hit
    </h6>
      A hit means you have suffered some minor injury. Every hit imposes a
      cumulative -1 penalty on all Fortitude saves to resist
      injury.
    <p>
      If a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#diabled">disabled</a> character suffers a hit, he becomes <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying">dying</a>.
    </p>

    <h6><a id="diabled"></a>
      Disabled
    </h6>
      A disabled character is conscious, but can only take a single move action
      or standard action each
      turn (nor can he take full-round
      actions). He moves at half speed. Taking a move action doesn�t risk
      further injury, but performing any standard action (or any other action
      the GM deems strenuous, including some free actions such as
      casting a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#quicken-spell">quickened</a> spell) worsens the character�s condition to dying
      (unless the action involved healing; see below).
    <p>
      If 5 or more points of magical healing are applied to a disabled
      character, he is no longer disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character can be both <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#staggered">staggered</a> and disabled. Becoming staggered while
      disabled does not worsen a character�s condition to dying. If a staggered
      and disabled character receives at least 5 points of healing, both
      conditions are removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A disabled character who suffers a hit or a disabled result from an attack
      becomes <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying">dying</a>.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="dying"></a>
      Dying
    </h6>
      A dying character is <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#unconscious">unconscious</a> and near death. Each round on his turn, a
      dying character must make a Fortitude save, DC 10, +1
      per turn after the first) to become  <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#stable">stable</a>. Penalties suffered from hits
      apply to this saving throw.
    <p>
      If the character fails the save, he <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#dead">dies</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the character succeeds on the save by less than 5, he does not die but
      does not improve. He is still dying and must continue to make Fortitude saves every
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the character succeeds on the save by 5 or more, he becomes conscious
      and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#diabled">disabled</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another character can improve a dying character�s condition to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#stable">stable</a> by
      making a DC 15 <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> check as a standard action
      (this provokes attacks of opportunity).
    </p>
    <p>
      A dying character who suffers a hit or a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#diabled">disabled</a> result from an attack is
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#dead">killed</a>.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="nonlethal-hit"></a>
      Nonlethal Hit
    </h6>
      A nonlethal hit means you have been battered and bruised and are in less
      than top condition. Every nonlethal hit you take imposes a cumulative -1
      penalty on your Fortitude saves to resist
      injury from nonlethal damage. Nonlethal hits do not affect Fortitude saves
      against lethal damage.
    <p>
      For example, a character with 4 hits and 3 nonlethal hits has a -4 penalty
      on Fortitude
      saves to resist injury from lethal damage, but a -7 penalty on saves
      to resist injury from non-lethal damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#staggered">staggered</a> character (see below) who suffers a nonlethal hit or becomes
      staggered as the result of an attack becomes <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#unconscious">unconscious</a>.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="staggered"></a>
      Staggered
    </h6>
      Being staggered is identical to being <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#diabled">disabled</a> (see above), except that if
      a character�s condition worsens, he becomes <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#unconscious">unconscious</a> instead of <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying">dying</a>.
    <p>
      If 5 or more points of magical healing are applied to a staggered
      character, he is no longer staggered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character can be both <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#diabled">disabled</a> and staggered. Becoming disabled while
      staggered does not worsen your condition to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#unconscious">unconscious</a>. If a staggered
      and disabled character receives at least 5 points of healing, both
      conditions are removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A staggered character who suffers a nonlethal hit or a staggered result
      from an attack falls <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#unconscious">unconscious</a>.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="unconscious"></a>
      Unconscious
    </h6>
      An unconscious character falls to the floor, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#helpless">helpless</a> and incapable of
      action. Additional nonlethal hits have no effect on the character. When he
      recovers one nonlethal hit, he becomes conscious.
    <h5><a id="healing"></a>
      HEALING
    </h5>
      Over time, or through magical healing, a character can reduce the number
      of hits he has. Some creatures have special abilities that affect the way
      in which they heal hits.
    <h6><a id="natural-healing"></a>
      Natural Healing
    </h6>
      With a full night�s rest, a character heals 1 hit per 2 character levels
      (minimum 1 hit per night). If he undergoes complete bed rest for 24 hours,
      he heals a number of hits equal to his character level. Any significant
      interruption during the rest period prevents the character from healing
      that night.
    <p>
      Nonlethal hits heal more quickly. A character heals nonlethal hits at a
      rate of 1 hit per hour per two character levels (minimum 1 hit per hour).
      If the GM chooses, he can prorate this healing so that it occurs more
      uniformly. For instance, a 12th-level character heals 6 nonlethal hits per
      hour; instead, the GM can allow her to heal 1 nonlethal hit per 10
      minutes.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="magical-healing"></a>
      Magical Healing
    </h6>
      For every 5 points of magical healing administered, a character eliminates
      1 lethal hit and 1 nonlethal hit.
    <h6><a id="special-healing-abilities"></a>
      Special Healing Abilities
    </h6>
      Some creatures have extraordinary or supernatural powers of healing.
    <p><b><a id="fast-healing"></a>Fast Healing:</b>
      A creature with fast healing can remove 1 lethal hit and 1 nonlethal hit
      per round per 5 points of fast healing (minimum 1 hit of each type). For
      example, a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersTtoZ.html#vampire-spawn">vampire spawn</a> has fast healing 2; it can therefore eliminate 1
      hit and 1 nonlethal hit per round.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature with fast healing may add its fast healing value to Fortitude saves made to
      become <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#stable">stable</a> when <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying">dying</a>. A dying vampire spawn, for example, gets a +2
      bonus on its Fortitude saves to become stable.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="regeneration"></a>Regeneration:</b>
      A creature with regeneration treats all damage as nonlethal, except for
      specific types of damage, given in the creature�s description, that affect
      it normally (such as a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersTtoZ.html#troll">troll�s</a> vulnerability to acid and fire). A creature
      with regeneration can remove 1 nonlethal hit per round per 5 points of
      regeneration (minimum 1 hit).
    </p>
    <h5><a id="special-damage-defenses"></a>
      SPECIAL DAMAGE DEFENSES
    </h5>
      Some creatures have special defenses against damage, such as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monsterTypes.html#DR">damage
      reduction</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monsterTypes.html#resistance-to-energy">resistance to energy</a>. Certain spells and effects also provide
      defenses against damage.
    <h6><a id="bonus-hit-points"></a>
      Bonus Hit Points
    </h6>
      Effects or abilities that normally give you bonus hit points (such as the
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#toughness">Toughness</a> feat or the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsAtoB.html#aid">aid</a> spell) instead add to your Fortitude saves to resist
      injury. For every 5 bonus hit points granted by the effect (round
      fractions up), add a +1 bonus on the save. For example, Toughness gives
      you a +1 on Fortitude saves to resist injury.
    <p>
      Extra hit points granted by an increased Constitution score don�t add to
      this save bonus, since your high Constitution already gives you a bonus on
      your Fortitude
      saves.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="damage-reduction-and-resistance-to-energy"></a>
      Damage Reduction and Resistance to Energy
    </h6>
      Damage reduction adds to your Fortitude save to resist
      injury. For every 5 points of damage reduction that apply
      against the incoming attack (round fractions up), add a +1 bonus on the
      save. For instance, a creature with DR 10/magic gains a +2 bonus on
      Fortitude saves to resist injury from damage dealt by nonmagical weapons.
    <p>
      Resistance to energy works the same way. A creature with resistance to
      fire 15 gains a +3 bonus on Fortitude Saves to resist
      fire damage.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="dealing-damage-to-objects"></a>
      Dealing Damage to Objects
    </h6>
      Objects can suffer the effects of lethal damage just as creatures can.
      Nonmagical, unattended objects have a base Fortitude save bonus of
      +0. A magic item has a Fortitude save bonus equal to +2 +1/2 its caster
      level. An item attended by a character makes saving throws as the
      character (or, in the case of a magic item, uses its own saving throw if
      better).
    <p>
      Add an object�s hardness to
      its Fortitude
      saves to resist injury. Furthermore, for every additional inch of
      thickness beyond the first, an object gains a +1 bonus on its save.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magic weapons, armor, and shields also add their enhancement bonus to their
      Fortitude saves against damage
    </p>
    <p>
      An object that takes any lethal hits has a cumulative -1 penalty on its
      future saves to resist injury from lethal damage, just as with characters.
      An object that is rendered <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#disabled">disabled</a> is broken or destroyed instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Objects are immune to nonlethal damage and thus don�t have to make
      Fortitude saves
      to resist injury from attacks that deal nonlethal damage.
    </p>

    <h6><a id="creatures-without-constitution-scores"></a>
      Creatures without Constitution Scores
    </h6>
      Some creatures, such as undead and constructs, do not have Constitution
      scores. Creatures without Constitution scores have a +4 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist
      injury. However, a creature with no constitution score that becomes
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#disabled">disabled</a> is destroyed instead.
    <p>
      Creatures that do not have Constitution scores are immune to nonlethal
      damage and thus don�t have to make Fortitude saves to resist
      injury from attacks that deal nonlethal damage.
    </p>
    <h5><a id="special-damage-effects"></a>
      SPECIAL DAMAGE EFFECTS
    </h5>
      This system changes the way some special damage effects work.
    <h6><a id="coup-de-grace"></a>
      Coup de Grace
    </h6>
      A coup de grace is handled as a normal attack, except that the result of
      the Fortitude
      save is treated as one category worse. (The save DC is usually higher
      than normal, as well, since the coup de grace is considered a critical hit
      and thus deals extra damage.)
    <p>
      On a successful save, the target takes 1 hit (or 1 nonlethal hit, if a
      nonlethal attack was used). If the save fails by less than 10, the target
      is <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#disabled">disabled</a> (or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#staggered">staggered</a>); and if the save fails by 10 or more, the
      target is <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying">dying</a> (or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#unconscious">unconscious</a>).
    </p>
    <h6><a id="massive-damage"></a>
      Massive Damage
    </h6>
     There is no massive
      damage threshold in this variant, since the greater the damage dealt,
      the higher the chance that a character will become <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#unconscious">unconscious</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying">dying</a>.
    <p>
      The GM could rule that a Fortitude save to resist
      injury that fails by 20 or more results in the character being rendered
      dying (or becoming unconscious, if the damage is nonlethal damage). This
      introduces the very real possibility that a single hit (such as a critical
      hit or a sneak attack) can take a character out.
    </p>

      This variant gives each character a capacity to recover quickly from
      injury. This capacity, measured as reserve points, replenishes lost hit
      points quickly after a fight. Thus, characters may be wounded and near
      death by the end of a fight, but then recover to full strength (or nearly
      full strength) before the next fight begins.
    <p>
      Reserve points work particularly well in low-magic campaigns or any game
      in which healing is rare, expensive, or otherwise hard to get.
    </p>
    <h5><a id="behind-the-curtain-reserve-points"></a>
      BEHIND THE CURTAIN: RESERVE POINTS
    </h5>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px">Even though this variant effectively doubles a character�s number of hit
      points, he can�t take a beating over and over again without depleting his
      capacity to recover. Reserve points effectively double the number of hit
      points a character can lose over the course of multiple fights but do not
      increase the damage a character can withstand in a single fight.</div>
    <h5><a id="using-reserve-points"></a>
      USING RESERVE POINTS
    </h5>
      A character�s quantity of reserve points is equal to his full normal hit
      point total.
    <p>
      After a character becomes injured (by losing hit points), reserve points
      begin automatically converting to hit points at the rate of 1 per minute
      of nonstrenuous activity (such as resting or hiking, but not climbing,
      swimming or fighting). Thus, for each minute of nonstrenuous activity, the
      character regains 1 hit point and loses 1 reserve point.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, Kroh has 22 hit points, so he also has 22 reserve points. In
      a battle with orcs, he takes 6 points of damage, dropping his hit points
      to 16. After the fight, Kroh�s reserve points begin to "convert" to hit
      points. Over the course of the next 6 minutes, his reserve point total
      drops by 6 and his hit point total increases by 6, up to his maximum of
      22. During the next fight, Kroh takes 24 points of damage, dropping him to
      -2, and then is dying for 5 rounds before stabilizing, leaving him at -7
      hit points. Over the next 16 minutes his remaining 16 reserve points
      convert to hit points. After 7 minutes he�s conscious but disabled (0 hp).
      After 8 minutes he�s back on his feet (1 hp), and after all 16 minutes
      he�s up to 9 hit points and 0 reserve points.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="nonlethal-damage-and-reserve-points"></a>Nonlethal damage:</b>
      Reserve points can also reduce a character�s nonlethal damage total. For
      each reserve point that converts to a hit point, a character also
      subtracts 1 point from his nonlethal damage. In addition, a character can
      take astandard
      action to "spend" a number of reserve points equal to or less than his
      HD to reduce his nonlethal damage an equal amount. (If a character has the
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#endurance">Endurance</a> feat, the GM might choose to make this a move action, to reflect
      the fact that such characters can more easily perservere through
      exhausting situations.)
    </p>
    <h5><a id="replenishing-reserve-points"></a>
      REPLENISHING RESERVE POINTS
    </h5>
      Characters naturally regain lost reserve points at the same rate that they
      naturally heal lost hit points. If a character receives any magical healing, that healing
      is applied first to the character�s lost hit points. Any excess healing
      left over after the character�s hit points are restored to full normal is
      applied to increase the character�s current reserve point total (up to its
      normal maximum).
    <p>
      For example, Kroh normally has 22 hit points, but he�s down to 9 hp and 0
      reserve points. He drinks a potion of cure moderate wounds, rolling 2d8 +
      3 and getting a result of 15. The first 13 points replenish his hit
      points; the remainder go to his reserve points. He now has 22 hit points
      and 2 reserve points.

      CONSTITUTION CHANGES
    </h5>
      If a character�s Constitution modifier goes up or down, his reserve points
      go up or down just as his hit points do. If a decrease in Constitution
      would drop a character�s reserve points below 0, any excess reduction is
      deducted from his current hit points.

      The massive
      damage rule is designed for games of heroic fantasy. It maintains the
      remote possibility that a single blow from a mighty opponent can kill a
      character, regardless of that character�s actual hit points.
    <p>
      Altering the massive damage rules can dramatically change the character�s
      attitude about combat. A lower threshold (the amount of damage that
      triggers a Fortitude
      save to avoid death) makes combat more deadly, perhaps turning any hit
      into a potentially life-threatening injury. On the other hand, a less
      deadly result on a failed save (<a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious">unconsciousness</a> instead of death, for
      instance) makes combat less dangerous, making a character�s current hit
      point total more important than any single hit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, then, are several alternative massive damage thresholds and results.
      You can combine different variants to create your own custom system. For
      instance, you might combine the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#hd-based-threshold">HD-based threshold</a> variant with the
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#size-based-threshold">size-based threshold</a> variant to create a massive damage threshold that
      takes into account both a creature�s Hit Dice and size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of the variant you use, each player should record his
      character�s massive damage threshold somewhere on the character sheet (to
      avoid mid-battle calculations), and the GM might want to add massive
      damage threshold values to monster and NPC statistics blocks for the same
      reason.
    </p>
    <h5><a id="alternative-threshold-levels"></a>
      ALTERNATIVE THRESHOLD LEVELS
    </h5>
      The 50-point threshold in the standard d20 rules can be altered in several
      ways.
    <p><b><a id="consitution-based-threshold"></a>Constitution-Based Threshold:</b>
      A character�s massive damage threshold is equal to his Constitution score. Whenever he takes damage
      from a single hit that equals or exceeds his current Constitution score,
      he must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or suffer
      the effects of massive damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an attack deals hit point damage and also changes the character�s
      Constitution score (such as a strike with a poisoned weapon), apply all
      effects of the hit before determining whether the damage is enough to
      trigger the saving
      throw. For instance, a character with a 14 Constitution is hit by a
      greatsword coated with <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#black-adders-venom">black adder venom</a>. The attack deals 12 points of
      damage, but the character also fails his Fortitude save against
      the poison and takes 3 points of Constitution damage. This lowers his
      Constitution � and hence his massive damage threshold � to 11. Since the
      damage exceeds the threshold, the character must now make a Fortitude save
      to avoid the effect of massive damage.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="hd-based-threshold"></a>HD-Based Threshold:</b>
      A character�s massive damage threshold is equal to 25, +2 per Hit Die.
      Whenever a character takes damage from a single hit that equals or exceeds
      this value, he must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or suffer
      the effects of massive damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a 5th-level human fighter has a massive damage threshold of
      35 (25 + [2 � 5]). A fire giant
      has a massive damage threshold of 55 (25
      + [2 � 15]).
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="size-based-threshold"></a>Size-Based Threshold:</b>
      A creature�s massive damage threshold is equal to 50, plus or minus 10
      points for every size category larger or smaller than Medium. Whenever a
      creature takes damage that equals or exceeds this value, it must succeed
      on a DC 15 Fortitude
      save or suffer the effects of massive damage.</p>
    <h5><a id="alternative-save-failure-results"></a>
      ALTERNATIVE SAVE FAILURE RESULTS
    </h5>
      Failed massive
      damage Fortitude
      save results can be alterd in several ways.

    <p><b><a id="dying-result"></a>Dying Result:</b>
      Instead of a failed Fotitude save against massive damage resulting in
      instant death, a failed save results in a character being reduced to -1
      hit point. The character becomes <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#dying">dying</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious">unconscious</a>, but can still
      become <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#stable">stable</a> or be helped by his friends, just like any other character
      who is reduced to -1 hp.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="near-death-result"></a>Near-Death Result:</b>
      Alternatively, instead of a failed Fortitude save against
      massive damage resulting in instant death, a failed save results in a
      character being reduced to -8 hp. The character is very close to death
      (having only a round or two to become <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#stable">stable</a> or receive help), but isn�t
      automatically killed.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="variable-result"></a>Variable Result:</b>
      For an added bit of random chance, a character who fails his Fortitude save against
      massive damage rolls 1d10 to determine his negative hit point total. A
      roll of 1 to 9 indicates that the character is <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#dying">dying</a> (at -1 hp on a 1, -2
      hp on a 2, and so forth). A roll of 10 leaves the character with -10 hit
      points, which means he is <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#dead">dead</a>.
    </p>
    <h5><a id="scaling-the-saving-throw"></a>
      SCALING THE SAVING THROW
    </h5>
      Another way to tweak the massive damage system
      is to scale the Fortitude save DC based
      on the damage taken. For every 10 points of damage dealt by an attack in
      excess of a character�s massive damage threschold, increase his Fortitude
      save DC by 2. This rule functions the same regardless of the threshold you
      choose to use.
    <p>
      For instance, if you use the standard 50-point threshold, a hit that deals
      50 to 59 points of damage requires a DC 15 save, 60 to 69 points DC 17, 70
      to 79 points DC 19, and so forth. If you use the Constitution-based
      threshold, a character with a Constitution of 15 would have to make a DC
      15 Fortitude save
      when taking 15 to 24 points from a single attack, DC 17 for 25 to 34
      points, DC 19 for 35 to 44 points, and so on.
    </p>
    <h5><a id="combining-massive-damage-variants"></a>
      COMBINING MASSIVE DAMAGE VARIANTS
    </h5>
      The massive
      damage variants given above can be combined in a number of ways.
    <p>
      To combine the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#constitution-based-threshold">Constitution-based threshold</a> variant with the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#hd-based-threshold">HD-based
      system</a>, simply use a character�s Constitution score instead of 25 to
      determine a character�s massive damage threshold. For example, a 3rd-level
      character with a Constitution of 14 has a massive damage threshold of 20
      (14 + [3 � 2]). In most cases, this calculation results in a threshold
      lower than the HD-based threshold but still higher than the
      Constitution-based threshold � retaining the "grittiness" of the
      Constitution-based system for low-to mid-level characters, while allowing
      higher-level characters to become braver in combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can easily combine the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#hd-based-threshold">HD-based system</a> with the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#size-based-threshold">size-based variant</a>:
      Use half of the base value for size instead of 20 to determine the massive
      damage threshold. For instance, a 1st-level human fighter (a Medium
      character) has a massive damage threshold of 27 (half of 50 is 25, plus 2
      � 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      You probably shouldn�t combine the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#constitution-based-threshold">Constitution-based system</a> with the
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#size-based-threshold">size-based variant</a>, since the threshold is already low enough that
      reducing it for Small or smaller characters unduly punishes them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alternate save failure results can be combined with any of the
      alternative threshold levels.
    </p>
    <h5><a id="behind-the-curtain-massive-damage-rules"></a>
      BEHIND THE CURTAIN: MASSIVE DAMAGE RULES
    </h5>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px">The variant systems for massive damage affect
      the game in different ways.
    <p>
      The <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#constitution-based-threshold">Constitution-based threshold</a> variant is deadiler than the standard
      massive damage system, since the threshold is so much lower. It�s best for
      low-level, low-power games, or campaigns bent on "gritty realism" in
      combat. You may want to allow characters the option of increasing their
      thresholds without improving their Constitution scores. For instance, a
      feat called Improved Damage Threshold that increased a character�s damage
      threshold by 3 would allow a low-Constitution character to increase his
      massive damage threshold quickly and easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike most other massive damage thresholds, the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#hd-based-threshold">HD-based variant</a> scales
      up with a character as he gains levels. At lower levels, the threshold is
      lower than the normal value, but still high enough that it rarely matters.
      At higher levels, a character�s massive damage threshold exceeds the value
      given in the standard d20 rules, increasing such characters� survivability
      in combat. It favors monsters whose Hit Dice greatly exceed their
      Challenge Ratings, such as giants and dragons, since their massive damage
      thresholds will end up higher than those of the characters fighting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#size-based-threshold">size-based threshold</a> variant hurts halfling and gnome PCs, as well as
      familiars and some animal companions. It generally favors monsters, since
      monsters tend to be larger than PCs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying-result">dying save result variant</a> tends to create less deadly combats, since a
      single save doesn�t spell automatic death. Still, a failed save can be
      just as critical to the tide of battle as in the standard system � a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#dying">dying</a>
      character is every bit as useless as a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#dead">dead</a> one, and is likely to bleed
      off resources from one or more other characters who attempt to save him
      from death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#near-death-result">near-death result</a> is almost as deadly as the standard system, but it
      gives a character a slim chance of surviving. It is particularly suited
      for heroic campaigns in which characters often find themselves at the
      brink of death, only to pull back from the edge at the last possible
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#variable-result">variable result</a> system is less deadly than the standard rules (since
      it allows for the likelihood that a character will survive for at least a
      few rounds), but removes the predictability of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying-result">dying result</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#near-death-result">near
      death result</a> variants. A lucky character might be reduced only to -1 hp,
      while an unlucky character might have mere seconds to survive until
      passing into the great beyond � if he gets any time at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#scaling-the-saving-throw">scaling saving throw</a> option
      makes high-level combat particularly dangerous to characters with poor
      Fortitude saves.
      Since those characters also tend to have low hit points, combat becomes
      doubly deadly, since they now must worry about individual attacks from
      powerful opponents as well as the normal attrition of hit points.

    <h3><a id="vitality-and-wound-points"></a>VITALITY AND WOUND POINTS</h3>

      </table>
      The vitality and wound points system was originally developed as a more
      cinematic method of handling damage than the traditional hit point system.
      The system allows for characters to improve the amount of punishment they
      can withstand as they go up in level, while still allowing for a single
      lucky attack to take down a character.
    <h5><a id="behind-the-curtain-vitality-and-wound-points"></a>
      BEHIND THE CURTAIN: VITALITY AND WOUND POINTS
    </h5>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px">Characters using this system should be more wary in combat, which can turn
      deadly in the space of a few lucky rolls. But they can also bounce back
      from a fight much more quickly. For that reason, this variant is an ideal
      system for low-magic campaigns or games where healing is otherwise rare.
    <p>
      A very weak creature in this system tends to be tougher to kill than in a
      standard d20 game, since its Constitution score is often higher than the
      number of hit points it might have had. Very big creatures are also more
      durable, due to their size
      modifier. This is reflected in the CR adjustments given in the variant
      rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures capable of dealing a large amount of damage on a single hit
      become significantly more deadly in this system, since a lucky attack roll can give a
      deadly blow to almost any character. For critical hits, consider reducing
      the additional damage from bonus damage dice (such as a flaming sword or a
      rogue�s sneak attack) to only 1 point per die. (Such attacks deal normal
      damage on noncritical hits.) That�s still pretty scary when fighting a
      high-level rogue, but not quite as terrifying as facing the possibility of
      an extra 5 or 10 dice of wound point damage with a successful sneak attack
      critical hit. You may find other places where damage needs adjustment in
      this system as well; don�t be afraid to tinker when needed to keep your
      game fun and exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constitution damage is especially deadly under this variant, since every
      point of Constitution damage reduces wound points by 1 and every 2 points
      of damage reduces vitality by a number of points equal to the character�s
      HD. If a character�s Constitution is reduced to 0, he dies even if he has
      wound points remaining.</p></div>
    <h5><a id="vitality-points"></a>
      VITALITY POINTS
    </h5>
      Vitality points are a measure of a character�s ability to turn a direct
      hit into a graze or a glancing blow with no serious consequences. Like hit
      points in the standard d20 rules, vitality points go up with level, giving
      high-level characters more ability to shrug off attacks. Most types of
      damage reduce vitality points.
    <p>
      Characters gain vitality points as they gain levels. Just as with hit
      points in the standard d20 rules, at each level a character rolls a
      vitality die and adds his Constitution modifier, adding the total to his
      vitality point total. (And, just as with hit points, a character always
      gains at least 1 vitality point per level, regardless of his roll or
      Constitution modifier.) A 1st-level character gets the maximum vitality
      die result rather than rolling, as shown on <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-vitality-points">Table: Vitality Points</a> below.

    <h5><a id="wound-points"></a>
      Wound Points
    </h5>
      Wound points measure how much true physical damage a character can
      withstand. Damage reduces wound points only after all vitality points are
      gone, or when a character is struck by a critical hit. A character has a
      number of wound points equal to her current Constitution score.
    <h5><a id="critical-hits"></a>
      Critical Hits
    </h5>
      A critical hit deals the same amount of damage as a normal hit, but that
      damage is deducted from wound points rather than from vitality points.
      Critical hits do not deal extra damage; for that reason, no weapon in this
      system has a damage multiplier for its critical hits.
    <p>
      Any critical hit automatically overcomes a creature�s <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monsterTypes.html#DR">damage reduction</a>,
      regardless of whether or not the attack could normally do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most weapons retain their normal critical threat range. If a weapon
      normally has a critical multiplier greater than �2, the weapon�s threat
      range expands by 1 point per additional multiplier, as indicated on the

      INJURY AND DEATH
    </h5>
      Vitality and wound points together measure how hard a character is to hurt
      and kill. The damage from each successful attack and each fight
      accumulates, dropping a character�s vitality point or wound point total
      until he runs out of points.
    <h6><a id="nonlethal-damage-and-wound-points"></a>
      Nonlethal Damage
    </h6>
      This system doesn�t differentiate between lethal and nonlethal damage.
      Attacks and effects that normally deal nonlethal damage reduce vitality
      points, except on a critical hit, in which case they reduce wound points.
    <h6><a id="zero-vitality-points"></a>
      0 Vitality Points
    </h6>
      At 0 vitality points, a character can no longer avoid taking real physical
      damage. Any additional damage he receives reduces his wound points.
    <h6><a id="taking-wound-damage"></a>
      Taking Wound Damage
    </h6>
      The first time a character takes wound damage � even a single point � he
      becomes <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#fatigued">fatigued</a>. A fatigued character can�t run or charge and takes a -2
      penalty to Strength and Dexterity until he has rested for 8 hours (or
      until the wound damage is healed, if that occurs first). Additional wound
      damage doesn�t make the character <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#exhausted">exhausted</a>.
    <p>
      In addition, any time an attack deals wound damage to a character, he must
      succeed on a Fortitude saving thow (DC 5 + number of wound points lost
      from the attack) or be <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#stunned">stunned</a> for 1d4 rounds. (During that time, any
      other character can take a standard action to
      help the stunned character recover; doing so ends the stunned condition.)
    </p>
    <h6><a id="zero-wound-points"></a>
      0 Wound Points
    </h6>
      Wound points cannot drop below 0; any damage that would cause a
      character�s wound point total to drop below 0 simply causes the character
      to have 0 wound points.
    <p>
      At 0 wound points, a character is <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#disabled-and-wound-points">disabled</a> and must attempt a DC 15
      Fortitude save.
      If he succeeds on the save, he is merely disabled. If he fails, he falls
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious">unconscious</a> and begins <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying-and-wound-points">dying</a>.

      A disabled character is conscious, but can only take a single move or
      standard
      action each turn (but not both, nor can she take full-round
      actions). She moves at half speed. Taking move actions doesn�t
      risk further injury, but performing any standard action (or any other
      action the GM deems strenuous, including some free actions such as
      casting a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#quicken-spell">quickened</a> spell) worsen the character�s condition to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying-and-wound-points">dying</a>

      If the character succeeds on the save by less than 5, he does not die but
      does not improve. He is still dying and must continue to make Fortitude saves every
      round.

    <p>
      If the character succeeds on the save by 5 or more but by less than 10, he

      Stable Characters and Recovery

      A stable character is <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious">unconscious</a>. Every hour, a stable character must
      succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10, +1

      If the character fails the save, he becomes <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying-and-wound-points">dying</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the character succeeds on the save by less than 5, he does not get any

      no longer in danger of dying.

    <p><b><a id="recovering-with-help"></a>Recovering with Help:</b>
      A dying character can be made stable with a DC 15 <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> check (a standard action that
      provokes attacks of opportunity). One hour after a tended, dying character

    <h5><a id="special-damage-situations"></a>
      SPECIAL DAMAGE SITUATIONS
    </h5>
      The vitality point system changes the way some special damage effects
      work.
    <h6><a id="coup-de-grace-and-wound-points"></a>
      Coup de Grace
    </h6>
      A coup de grace functions normally in that it automatically hits and
      scores a critical hit (and thus the damage dealt is applied to the
      target�s wound points). If the defender survives the damage, he must make
      a Fortitude save
      (DC 10 + the amount of damage dealt) or die.
    <h6><a id="massive-damage-and-wound-points"></a>
      Massive Damage
    </h6>
      The massive
      damage rule does not apply under this system.

    <h5><a id="healing-and-wound-points"></a>
      HEALING
    </h5>
      After taking damage, a character can recover vitality and wound points
      through natural healing (over the course of hours or days), or by magic.
      In any case, a character can�t regain vitality points or wound points
      above his full normal totals.

    <h6><a id="natural-healing-and-wound-points"></a>
      Natural Healing
    </h6>
      Characters recover vitality points at a rate of one vitality point per
      hour per character level.
    <p>
      With a full night�s rest, a character recovers 1 wound point per character
      level (minimum 1 per night), or twice that amount with complete bed rest
      for 24 hours. Any significant interruption during the rest period prevents
      the character from healing that night.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="assisted-healing-and-wound-points"></a>
      Assisted Healing
    </h6>
      A character who provides <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">long-term care</a>
      doubles the rate at which a wounded character recovers lost vitality and
      wound points.
    <h6><a id="magical-healing-and-wound-points"></a>
      Magical Healing
    </h6>
      Spells that heal hit point damage work somewhat differently in this
      system. For spells that heal a variable amount of hit point damage based
      on a die roll (such as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsC.html#cure-light-wounds">cure light wounds</a>), apply the actual die roll as
      restored vitality points, and any modifier to the die roll (such as caster
      level, for cure spells) as restored wound points.
    <p>
      For example, cure moderate wounds heals 2d8 points of damage, +1 point per
      caster level (maximum +10). Under this system, a 10th-level cleric could
      cast it to heal 2d8 vitality points and 10 wound points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spells or effects that return a number of hit points not based on a die
      roll, such as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsHtoI.html#heal">heal</a>, apply the healing to lost wound points first, then to
      lost vitality. For example, an 11th-level cleric casting heal has 110
      points of healing to apply. If the target has taken 12 points of wound
      damage and 104 points of vitality damage, the spell heals all the wound
      damage and 98 points of the vitality damage, leaving the target with only
      6 points of vitality damage remaining.
    </p>
    <h5><a id="npcs-and-monsters"></a>
      NPCs AND MONSTERS
    </h5>
      Vitality points are only granted by the "heroic" classes, such as the
      standard character classes and various prestige classes. The NPC
      classes � adept, aristocrat, commoner, expert and warrior � grant no vitality
      points (either at 1st level or thereafter). Such characters have wound
      points equal to their Constitution score. Thus, a typical 1st-level orc
      warrior has no vitality points and 12 wound points. All damage dealt to
      such creatures is applied to their wound points.
    <p>
      Most monsters, on the other hand, have both wound points and vitality
      points. For Small, Medium and Large creatures, a monster�s wound point
      total is equal to its current Constitution score. Creatures smaller or
      larger than that have their wound point total multiplied by a factor based
      on their size, as indicated on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      A monster�s vitality point total is equal to the number of hit points it
      would normally have, based on its type and Constitution score. The GM may
      choose not to assign vitality points to creatures that pose little or no
      threat to PCs, such as domesticated herd animals.

      Creatures without Constitution Scores
    </h6>
      Some creatures, such as undead and constructs, do not have Constitution
      scores. If a creature has no Constitution score, it has no vitality
      points. Instead, it has wound points equal to the number of vitality
      points it would have based on its HD and type. Such creatures are never
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#fatigued">fatigued</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#stunned">stunned</a> by wound damage.
    <h6><a id="bonus-hit-points-and-wound-points"></a>
      Bonus Hit Points
    </h6>
      If a creature would have bonus hit points based on its type, these are
      treated as bonus wound points. (For example, a Medium <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monsterTypes.html#construct">construct</a> gets 20
      bonus wound points.) The same holds true for any permanent effect that
      increases a character�s hit point total (such as the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#toughness">Toughness</a> feat, which
      adds 3 to the character�s wound point total).
    <h6><a id="damage-reduction-and-wound-points"></a>
      Damage Reduction
    </h6>
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monsterTypes.html#DR">Damage reduction</a> functions normally, reducing damage dealt by attacks.
      However, any critical hit automatically overcomes a creature�s damage
      reduction, regardless of whether the attack could normally do so. For
      example, a critical hit against a skeleton (DR 5/bludgeoning) overcomes
      the creature�s damage reduction even if it was hit with a weapon that does
      not deal bludgeoning damage.

    <h6><a id="fast-healing-and-wound-points"></a>
      Fast Healing
    </h6>
      Creatures with <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monsterTypes.html#fast-healing">fast healing</a> regain vitality points at an exceptionally
      fast rate, usually 1 or more vitality points per round, as given in the
      creature�s description (for example, a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersTtoZ.html#vampire">vampire</a> has fast healing 5).
    <p>
      If a creature with fast healing has no Constitution score, fast healing
      restores lost wound points instead. The same doesn�t apply to creatures
      that have no vitality points but do have a Constitution score (such as a
      human warrior or domestic animal). Such creatures gain no benefit from
      fast healing.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="regeneration-and-wound-points"></a>
      Regeneration
    </h6>
      All damage dealt to creatures with <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monsterTypes.html#regeneration">regeneration</a> is vitality point damage,
      even in the case of critical hits. The creature automatically heals
      vitality point damage at a fixed rate per round, as given in the entry
      (for example, a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersTtoZ.html#troll">troll</a> has regeneration 5). A regenerating creature that
      runs out of vitality points becomes <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#fatigued">fatigued</a> just as if it had taken wound
      point damage. Excess damage, however, does not reduce its wound points.
      Certain attack forms, typically fire and acid, automatically deal wound
      damage to a regenerating creature, though it may attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 +
      damage dealt) to convert this to vitality damage, which it can regenerate
      normally. Otherwise, regeneration functions as
      described in the standard rules and in individual monster descriptions.

      Under the standard d20 rules, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious">unconsciousness</a> and death are predictable
      states: When a character reaches negative hit points, he goes unconscious.
      When he reaches -10, he dies.
    <p>
      This variant takes away some of that predictability. No longer does a
      dying character have a set number of rounds to live. This heightens the
      tension in combat when one of your allies has fallen, because you don�t
      know exactly when the clock is going to run out.

      BEHIND THE CURTAIN: DEATH AND DYING
    </h5>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px">This variant system increases a character�s chance of surviving in combat
      against monsters that deal out tremendous amounts of damage per attack,
      since any character brought to 0 hit points against such a creature has a
      chance of survival. It eliminates the fear that every high-level character
      has faced: taking damage from a creature�s attack that knocks him down
      close to 0 hit points, knowing that a second attack is coming and it will
      probably send him well below -10 hit points.
    <p>
      This variant also reduces some of the swing factor of massive damage,
      since a single blown save won�t make the difference between life and
      death. In fights against monsters who can routinely deliver 50 or more
      points of damage per hit � not terribly uncommon at higher levels � this keeps
      combat from being a grim game of "Who will be the first to roll a natural
      1?"

    <h5><a id="zero-hit-points"></a>
      0 Hit Points

      With this variant, characters can�t be reduced to negative hit points � 0 is
      the minimum. There is no automatic hit point total at which a character
      dies. Instead, any character who takes damage that reduces his hit points
      to 0 must make a Fortitude save to avoid
      falling <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unincscious">unconscious</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying-and-death">dying</a>.

      When a character�s hit points are reduced to 0, he must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10, +2
      per 10 points of damage dealt by the attack or effect). Success means the
      character is <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#disabled-and-death">disabled</a>; failure indicates that he is <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying-and-death">dying</a>. Failure by 10

      he is dying. Calculate the numeric result; if he missed the DC by 10 or
      more, he is dead.)
    <p>
      The possible results of the save are as follows.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="disabled-and-death"></a>Disabled:</b>
      A disabled character is conscious, but can only take a single move or
      standard
      action each turn (but not both, nor can she take full-round
      actions). She moves at half speed. Taking move actions doesn�t
      risk further injury, but if a disabled character takes any standard action
      (or any other action the GM deems strenuous, including some free actions such as
      casting a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#quicken-spell">quickened</a> spell), she must succeed on a Fortitude save (against
      the same DC as the save made when reduced to 0 hit points) to remain
      disabled; otherwise, she becomes <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying-and-death">dying</a> after she completes the action. If
      a disabled character takes any lethal damage, she must make a new
      Fortitude save (DC 10, +2 per 10 points of damage dealt by the attack or
      effect), but any result other than <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dead-and-death">dead</a> means the character is now dying.
      A disabled character who is dealt (or who is currently suffering from) any
      nonlethal damage becomes <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious">unconscious</a> (since the character�s nonlethal
      damage now exceeds his hit points) but does not begin dying.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="dying-and-death"></a>Dying:</b>
      A dying character is <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious">unconscious</a> and near death. Each round on his turn, a
      dying character must make a Fortitude save (DC 10, +1
      per turn after the first) to become <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#stable-and-death">stable</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the character fails the save, he <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dead-and-death">dies</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the character succeeds on the save by less than 5, he does not die but
      does not improve. He is still dying and must continue to make Fortitude saves every
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the character succeeds on the save by 5 or more but by less than 10, he
      becomes stable but remains unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the character succeeds on the save by 10 or more, he becomes conscious
      and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#disabled-and-death">disabled</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another character can make a dying character <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#stable-and-death">stable</a> by succeeding on a DC
      15 <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> check as a standard action
      (which provokes attacks of opportunity).
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="stable-and-death"></a>Stable:</b>
      A stable character is <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious">unconscious</a>. Every hour, a stable character must
      succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10, +1
      per hour after the first) to remain stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the character fails the save, he becomes <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying-and-death">dying</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the character succeeds on the save by less than 5, he does not get any
      worse, but does not improve. He is still stable and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious">unconscious</a>, and must
      continue to make Fortitude saves every
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the character succeeds on the save by 5 or more, he becomes conscious
      and has 1 hit point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another character can grant a stable character a +2 bonus on his Fortitude save to remain
      stable by tending to him for at least 10 minutes during the hour between
      saves and by making a DC 15 <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> check.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="dead-and-death"></a>Dead:</b>
      A dead character�s soul immediately departs the body, and getting it back
      into the body is a major hassle. Unless you have access to powerful divine
      magic, you can�t do much to a dead character except go through his pockets
      for loose gold pieces.
    </p>
    <h5><a id="healing-and-death"></a>
      Healing
    </h5>
      A <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#disabled-and-death">disabled</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="stable-and-death">stable</a>, or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="dying-and-death">dying</a> character has 0 hit points. Healing that
      raises her above 0 hit points makes her conscious and fully functional
      again, just as if she had never been reduced to 0. A spellcaster retains
      the spellcasting ability she had before dropping to 0 hit points. (Of
      course, a character suffering from nonlethal damage
      equal to or in excess of her current hit points must still deal with the
      ramification of that state.)
    <p>
      For example, Tirsa is smashed by a hill giant�s club for 26 points of
      damage, but she only has 14 hit points left. She is reduced to 0 hit
      points. She must immediately attempt a DC 14 Fortitude save (base DC
      10, +4 because the damage dealt was at least 20 points but less than 30
      points). She rolls a 5, so she is <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious">unconscious</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying-and-death">dying</a>. (Had she rolled
      any worse, the attack would have killed her outright.)
    </p>

    <p>
      On her next turn, she must succeed on a DC 10 Fortitude save to become
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#stable-and-dying">stable</a>. She rolls a 13, which is enough to remain dying but not good
      enough to become stable. Next round, the DC increases to 11, and she rolls
      a 16. Since that result exceeds the DC by at least 5 points, Tirsa becomes
      stable but remains <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious">unconscious</a>. Assuming that she isn�t healed by her
      friends (or slain by her enemies) in the meantime, she must succeed on a
      DC 10 Fortitude save 1 hour later to remain stable.
    </p>
    <h5><a id="massive-damage-and-death"></a>
      MASSIVE DAMAGE
    </h5>
      If a single attack deals sufficient damage to force a saving throw against
      massive damage (typically 50 points, though if you use a variant system � see <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#massive-damage-thresholds-and-results">Massive
      Damage Thresholds and Results</a>, above � that amount may vary dramatically),
      the target of the attack makes a Fortitude save as normal.
      If the save fails, the target�s hit point total is reduced to 0, and he
      must immediately attempt a second Fortitude save (DC 10, +2 per 10 points
      of damage dealt by the attack or effect) to determine if he is <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dead-and-death">dead</a>,
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying-and-death">dying</a>, or merely <a style="color: #579eb6" href="disabled-and-death">disabled</a> (as outlined above).
    <p>
      For example, Kroh is blasted by the fiery breath of an old red dragon.
      Failing his Reflex
      save, he takes 88 points of fire damage. Thankfully, Kroh wears a
      major ring of fire resistance, which reduces this damage by 20 points to
      68. This number is far lower than his current hit points, but is enough
      damage to trigger a DC 15 Fortitude save due to
      massive damage. Unfortunately, Kroh rolls a natural 1 on the saving throw and is
      reduced to 0 hit points. He must now attempt a Fortitude save to see if he
      is merely disabled, dying, or if this attack slays him outright. The DC is
      22 (base 10, +12 because the damage dealt is at least 60 points but not 70
      points). This time Kroh rolls a 23, which is good enough to remain
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#disabled-and-death">disabled</a>. Kroh remains conscious, but may attempt only a standard action or a
      move action (plus free
      actions) each round, and if he tkes a standard action, he must take
      another DC 22 Fortitude save to remain disabled after taking that action.
      If he fails that save, or if he takes even a single point of lethal
      damage, he is rendered <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious">unconscious</a> and begins <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#dying-and-death">dying</a> (or may be slain
      outright).
