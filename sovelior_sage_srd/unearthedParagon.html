            In most campaigns, the ideas of class and race are separate
            concepts. But with racial paragon classes, the line between the two
            becomes blurred. Racial paragons are, as their name suggests, nearly
            ideal examples of the strengths and abilities of the character's
            race. Unlike members of other classes, however, racial paragons are
            more than merely powerful individuals. They are strong in all the
            ways that their race is strong, while still vulnerable in the ways
            that their race is vulnerable. Beyond that, they possess powers or
            capabilities that supersede those of normal members of their race.
            While any elf might rise in power, prestige, and (in game terms)
            level, most do so by gaining levels in the standard character
            classes � only a few are so much in tune with their heritage and
            racial abilities that they become racial paragons.
            <p>
              Racial paragons rarely undergo the rigorous training or study that
              members of other classes commonly undertake between levels. Their
              experience, wisdom, and heroic abilities simply manifest in the
              form of superior innate racial abilities. Despite this strong
              association with race, racial paragons need not have specific
              views or special dedication to their race's beliefs or typical
              attitudes (although many do).
            </p>
            <p>
              Obviously, a character can only take levels in the racial paragon
              class associated with his race. A human cannot take levels in
              dwarf paragon � only dwarves are capable of reflecting the highest
              virtues of dwarfhood by gaining levels in the dwarf paragon class.
            </p>
              (Half-elves and half-orcs are an exception; see the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#half-elf-paragon">Half-Elf Paragon</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#half-orc-paragon">Half-Orc Paragon</a> sections below.)

            <p>
              Like the fighter, the wizard, and the other standard character
              classes, the racial paragon classes have no prerequisites (other
              than being a member of the appropriate race). Paragon class levels
              can be taken any time a character gains a new level, even at 1st
              level (in which case they receive four times the normal number of
              skill points gained at each succeeding level). A character can
              multiclass freely between standard character classes, prestige
              classes for which he or she qualifies, and the character's
              appropriate racial paragon class.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's possible for a powerful magic effect such as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsS.html#shapechange">shapechange</a>,
              <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#reincarnate">reincarnate</a>, or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsTtoZ.html#wish">wish</a> to change a character's race. If a
              character has already taken racial paragon levels in his original
              race, he can never become a paragon of another race. However, such
              shapechanging and form-altering magics also cause no loss of a
              paragon's class abilities � the class abilities gained from racial
              paragon levels are affected no more or less drastically than
              benefits gained from having levels in any other class.
            </p>

            <p>
              Levels in racial paragon classes never result in XP penalties for
              multiclass characters.

              <a id="subraces-and-paragon-classes"></a> SUBRACES AND PARAGON
              CLASSES
            </h5>
            <p>
              As a general rule, a member of a subrace can take levels in the
              standard race's paragon class unless a specific paragon class
              exists for the subrace. For example, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersEtoF.html#aquatic-elf">aquatic elves</a>,
              <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersEtoF.html#gray-elf">gray elves</a>,
              <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersEtoF.html#wild-elf">wild elves</a>, and
              <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersEtoF.html#wood-elf">wood elves</a> may all advance as
              <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#elf-paragon">elf paragons</a>, but <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersEtoF.html#drow-elf">drow elves</a> may not, because drow
              have a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#drow-paragon">separate paragon class</a>. If you
              wanted to further differentiate the elven subraces by creating a
              paragon class for one or more of the subraces, those subraces
              could not then take levels of elf paragon.
            </p>

            <p>
              When deciding whether to create new paragon classes for subraces
              in your game, consider how different the subrace is from the main
              race. For instance, the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersEtoF.html#gray-elf">gray
              elf</a> is very similar to the standard <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersEtoF.html#elf">(high) elf</a>, but both the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersEtoF.html#wild-elf">wild elf</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersEtoF.html#wood-elf">wood elf</a> receive a penalty to
              Intelligence, suggesting that the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#elf-paragon">elf
              paragon's</a> Intelligence increase at 3rd level might not be
              appropriate for those races. The <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersG.html#forest-gnome">forest gnome</a> is very similar to
              the standard <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersG.html#gnome">(rock) gnome</a>, but
              the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersG.html#svirfneblin-gnome">svirfneblin</a> is
              so different (including a +3 level adjustment) that it probably
              deserves its own paragon class.

            <h5>
              <a id="paragon-classes-in-your-game"></a> PARAGON CLASSES IN
              YOUR GAME
            </h5>
            <p>
              Like many of the variants rules, racial paragons can be a powerful
              tool for shaping a campaign world or play experience. Including
              racial paragons in a campaign is as easy as allowing players to
              advance in the classes or designing NPCs with class levels from
              the appropriate paragon class. However, this variant can be more
              than just another long list of possible classes. By allowing
              different subsets of the racial paragon classes to be present in
              your game, you can shape which races are the most influential or
              numerous in the campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, in a setting in which elves and dwarves have all but
              died out, the traditions of their racial paragon classes might
              have been lost. In the same campaign, however, humans, half-orcs,
              and halflings all thrive, and powerful NPCs of these races might
              frequently have a level or two in the appropriate paragon class.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, the prevalence of racial paragons can reflect the
              importance of racial issues. In campaigns where tensions run high
              between the civilized races, each race is more likely to have a
              large number of racial paragons among its members. As the cause of
              expanding humanity's borders into the wilderness becomes more and
              more important to the race, more human paragons come to the fore �
              while halflings in the same campaign, content and secure with
              their lot in life, turn to other classes and pursuits less tied to
              the goals of their race.
            </p>
            <p>
              You might choose to create your own racial paragon classes. When
              creating a racial paragon class for a race with a level adjustment
              of +1 or higher (such as drow or half-dragon), it's acceptable for
              the class to be a little better than a paragon class for a race
              with a level adjustment of +0. In general, the benefits of a race
              with a level adjustment tend to decrease in value as the character
              gains levels, and an above-average paragon class can help that
              race maintain its edge.

              Separated from the rest of the elven people by a legacy of deceit,
              betrayal, and evil, the drow are easily one of the most dangerous
              of the humanoid races. Most drow paragons embody all their race's
              evil nature and delight in calculated cruelty, but some manage to
              pull away from this dark path, instead embodying the potential
              that all elves share for beauty, grace, and martial skill.
            <p>
              Drow society is full of intrigue and fierce competition. Even the
              most able drow paragons can do little more to advance their race
              than to strive against the machinations of other powerful drow.
              When they succeed in breaking away from drow culture and its cruel
              influence, however, good-aligned drow paragons can be the most
              able and successful members of their race.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="drow-paragon-adventures"></a><b>Adventures:</b> Drow paragons adventure for one of two reasons.
              Those of an evil bent adventure to increase their own personal
              power, by acquiring wealth and powerful magic items or by
              improving their combat skills. Those few drow paragons with less
              selfish motives adventure to remove themselves from the influence
              of their race's harsh and cruel society. These latter drow
              paragons are the ones most likely to be seen in the company of
              other races.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="drow-paragon-characteristics"></a><b>Characteristics:</b> Drow paragons are typically more reserved
              than other members of their race. Drow paragons consider
              themselves the elite of drow society, although they are careful
              about sharing these viewpoints with the powerful priestesses that
              hold sway over most aspects of drow culture. If anything, drow
              paragons are even more secretive and devious than average members
              of their race, and their success in such dangerous society
              emphasizes their ability to navigate treacherous social
              environments and manipulate the actions of others. It is said that
              the day a drow stops scheming is the day of her death.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="drow-paragon-alignment"></a><b>Alignment:</b> The vast majority of drow, including most drow
              paragons, are unrelentingly evil. However, the few good-aligned
              drow who survive their formative years are actually quite likely
              to gain levels in the drow paragon class. This makes good-aligned
              drow paragons more frequent than good drow of other classes, but
              still nowhere near as common as evil-aligned drow paragons.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="drow-paragon-religion"></a><b>Religion:</b> Much of drow culture is dominated by religion,
              and the powerful priestesses who rule drow society see drow
              paragons as tools � more skilled than other ambitious drow, perhaps,
              but no more inherently valuable. This outlook chafes against the
              drow paragons own belief that she is the elite of her race. As a
              result, drow paragons are unlikely to follow religion of any kind
              when removed from the direct influence of the drow priestesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="drow-paragon-background"></a><b>Background:</b> Drow paragons learn their skills just as other
              drow do: by succeeding where weaker drow fail. Drow paragons build
              their skills among the hidden dangers of the subterranean realms
              and in a society where the powerful freely prey upon the weak.
              Regardless of alignment or other abilities, drow paragons are all
              forced at some point to make a decision about their race's cruel
              and everpresent religion. Those drow paragons who choose to follow
              the tenets of the evil priestesses often rise to become deadly
              lieutenants, carrying out the will of the matriarchs. The few who
              reject the priestesses' teachings must do so quietly and covertly,
              biding their time until they can escape the influence of other
              drow.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="drow-paragon-races"></a><b>Races:</b> Most drow paragons have little use for members of
              the other races, viewing them only as potential prey or slaves.
              Good-aligned drow paragons, however, see the merits of interracial
              cooperation. These paragons seek out adventurers of other races,
              often coming to relate more to the societies of their adventuring
              companions than to their own culture.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="drow-paragon-other-classes"></a><b>Other Classes:</b> Drow paragons see members of other classes
              as tools. They value a broad skill set in those with whom they
              associate, provided they can control the actions of these
              associates when the need arises. Drow paragons are willing to work
              with anyone they can manipulate to their own ends.
            </p>
            <p>
              That said, drow paragons often see fighters as ideal companions
              because they combine great martial proficiency with physical
              prowess, while at the same time they are typically incapable of
              matching the drow's stealth and subtlety�ensuring that the drow
              paragon can gain the upper hand whenever desired.

              Drow paragons have the following game statistics.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Abilities:</b> Drow paragons favor fighting from ambush, making
              Dexterity important for its role in sneaking and striking with
              ranged weapons. Wisdom helps in detecting a potential foe before
              the foe detects the drow in turn. Strength is also important due
              to its obvious role in melee combat.

              Class Features
            </h6>
            <p>
              All of the following are class features of the drow paragon class.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Drow paragons are proficient
              with all simple weapons, rapiers, longswords, and hand crossbows,
              and with light armor.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Spells per Day:</b> At 1st and 3rd level, a female drow paragon
              gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in
              <a style="color: #579eb6" href="cleric.html">cleric</a>. A male drow paragon instead gains new spells per day as if
              he had gained a level of <a style="color: #579eb6" href="wizard.html">wizard</a>. The paragon does not, however,
              gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained
              (bonus metamagic feats, and so on). This essentially means that
              the character adds the level of drow paragon to her level in
              cleric or wizard, then determines spells per day and caster level
              accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the drow paragon is female and has no levels in cleric, or is
              male and has no levels in wizard, this class feature has no
              effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="drow-paragon-improved-spell-like-abilities"></a><b>Improved Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At 1st level, a drow paragon
              gains one additional daily use of each of her innate spell-like
              abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="drow-paragon-improved-darkvision"></a><b>Improved Darkvision (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, a drow paragon's
              darkvision range increases by 30 feet.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="drow-paragon-light-sensitivity"></a><b>Light Sensitivity (Ex):</b> A 2nd-level drow paragon's light
              blindness is lessened to light sensitivity. Instead of being
              <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#blinded">blinded</a> by bright light, she is merely <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#dazzled">dazzled</a> in bright sunlight
              or within the radius of a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsDtoE.html#daylight">daylight</a> spell.

            <p>
              <a id="drow-paragon-ability-boost"></a><b>Ability Boost (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, a drow paragon's
              Dexterity score increases by 2 points.

              Known for their skill in warfare, their ability to withstand
              physical and magical punishment, and their great love of stone and
              stonework, dwarves grow as strong as their mountain homes. Dwarf
              paragons exemplify this strength, gaining a deeper intuitive
              understanding of stone and stonework, building upon their already
              proven toughness, and promoting the crafts and strengths of their
              people whenever possible.
            <p>
              Dwarf paragons are doughty warriors, and powerful paragons often
              take the lead in battles as well as diplomatic engagements.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="dwarf-paragon-adventures"></a><b>Adventures:</b> Dwarf paragons stand at the forefront of their
              people, ready to defend or promote the interests of their race
              through word and deed. Although they are as disparate a group as
              the members of any character class, most dwarf paragons undertake
              adventure freely, as along as it does not threaten or endanger a
              dwarven community.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="dwarf-paragon-charactersistics"></a><b>Characteristics:</b> Dwarf paragons are tough, skilled warriors
              who are most at home when deep underground. Because of their
              martial focus, dwarf fighters and paladins are likely to become
              paragons, although many clerics also find that their race's innate
              abilities and interests blend well with their divine training, and
              they frequently take levels in dwarf paragon as well. Because of
              their race's ability with weaponsmithing and other crafts, dwarf
              paragons are likely to look down upon weapons and gear made by
              members of other races.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="dwarf-paragon-alignment"></a><b>Alignment:</b> Dwarf paragons can be of any alignment, but
              their interest in the success of their communities and their
              ingrained sense of dwarven honor ensures that many act in a lawful
              and good manner. Neutral dwarf paragons are found more frequently
              in areas where relations with other good races have become
              strained, or where the different races focus more on the interests
              of their people than on morality.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="dwarf-paragon-religion"></a><b>Religion:</b> Religion is an important part of many dwarven
              communities, and thus dwarf paragons often exemplify this aspect
              of dwarven life as they exemplify all others. Many dwarf paragons
              are also clerics of dwarven deities, and the two philosophies
              support and reinforce each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="dwarf-paragon-background"></a><b>Background:</b> Although many dwarf paragons grow into their
              power in the hearts of strong and strident dwarven communities,
              some rise from areas where dwarves have been oppressed or even
              defeated. Whatever their origins, dwarf paragons are tough,
              determined folk who seek out specialized training and master
              complex tasks to further the aims of their people. Dwarf paragons
              are often descended from heroes of older generations, and these
              individuals may seek to honor their ancestors' memory through
              deeds of their own.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="dwarf-paragon-races"></a><b>Races:</b> Dwarf paragons are all dwarves, of course, and like
              other racial paragons, their actions and efforts are motivated
              primarily by the interests of their people. Despite their focus on
              their own race's innate abilities, they remain surprisingly open
              to adventuring with members of other races. In most cases, it is
              practicality that drives a paragon more than anything else once a
              dwarf paragon has decided on a course of action, he uses whatever
              and whomever is at hand to accomplish the task.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dwarf paragons, like other members of their race, consider the
              building of trust and friendship a long, slow task that cannot be
              rushed. Although it might take a hundred years or more to earn a
              dwarf paragon's complete trust, dwarf paragons are by no means a
              suspicious lot.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="dwarf-paragon-other-classes"></a><b>Other Classes:</b> In general, the reactions of a dwarf paragon
              are governed more by how an individual or race interacts with the
              dwarven community than by class or personal training but some
              general attitudes are common to most dwarf paragons. Dwarf
              paragons generally get along well with dwarf fighters, paladins,
              and clerics, although they appreciate anyone who is willing to
              work in the best interests of the dwarven people. Dwarf paragons
              see wizards and sorcerers as important allies in the defense and
              promotion of the dwarven people, but powerful spellcasters of any
              kind can pose a threat to an entire community, making dwarf
              paragons wary of their power.

              Dwarf paragons have the following game statistics.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Abilities:</b> Strength is important for dwarf paragons because
              they often serve as defenders of their people and emphasize their
              own martial training. Constitution is important not only to a
              dwarf paragon's ability to stay on his feet in battle, but also
              because physical toughness is a hallmark of the dwarf race.

              Accomplished with both spell and blade, elves move through the
              world at a pace removed from that of shorter-lived races.
              Long-standing champions of good, the elf race is storied beyond
              telling and peopled by heroes beyond counting. As mighty as the
              elf race can be, it is not often that elves turn to warfare or
              combat, preferring instead the paths of poetry, dance, song, and
              lore. With their long life spans and many talents, elves excel in
              numerous areas and classes, but a few exemplify to an even greater
              degree the complex and powerful nature of their race.
            <p>
              <a id="elf-paragon-adventures"></a><b>Adventures:</b> Elf paragons retreat from the world less
              readily than most elves, seeing much of the nature of the elf race
              in the form and shape of the world. They enjoy travel and
              interaction with other races, learning as much about themselves in
              the process as they do about those they meet. Elf paragons are
              aware that voluntary isolation from other good-aligned races poses
              a great danger to the elven race � although such self-absorption
              lessens the pain and frustration involved in dealing with other
              races, it leaves an elven community vulnerable to stagnation and
              decline.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="elf-paragon-characteristics"></a><b>Characteristics:</b> Elf paragons are curious, patient, and,
              when roused to action, deadly. They are swift and stealthy and
              have amazingly acute senses, allowing them to react far faster
              than opponents might expect. Their aptitude in both stealth and
              weapons makes them excellent at attacking from ambush, and their
              propensity to take <a style="color: #579eb6" href="rogue.html">rogue</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="ranger.html">ranger</a> levels in addition to their
              paragon levels accentuates these strengths.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="elf-paragon-alignment"></a><b>Alignment:</b> Elf paragons can be of any alignment, but most
              are neutral good. They see the world as a place of harmony, a
              place that can provide bounty to all those willing to live in
              peace so long as society is not pushed to extremes of law or
              anarchy.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="elf-paragon-religion"></a><b>Religion:</b> Although elves as a whole can be as religious as
              members of any other race, elf paragons rarely concentrate on
              religion. Instead, they focus their attention and devotion on the
              mortal members of their race.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="elf-paragon-background"></a><b>Background:</b> Most elf paragons come into their abilities
              through a strong love of their people and the work of an
              influential mentor. Although this mentor may be of any class, it
              is often the lorekeepers and wizards of the elf race who seek to
              foster the skills of fledgling elf paragons, knowing that one
              young elf turning to the path of the paragon can benefit the race
              for nearly a thousand years.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="elf-paragon-races"></a><b>Races:</b> Elf paragons are, for the most part, open and
              gracious when dealing with members of other races. Even if she
              secretly looks down on shorter-lived and less gifted folk, an elf
              paragon knows that other races can offer her the one thing that
              most elves lack: a sense of urgency. As an elf paragon grows in
              power, she becomes more and more apt to look upon members of other
              races as curiosities to be studied rather than as peers � but she
              remains gracious and trusting, striving to learn how the virtues
              of other races might benefit the elf race.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="elf-paragon-other-classes"></a><b>Other Classes:</b> Like most racial paragons, elf paragons tend
              to think more in terms of relations with other races than they do
              about interactions with other classes. Elf paragons relate best to
              characters who revere nature or seek to live in harmony with the
              world around them. They find common philosophical ground with
              <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monk.html">monks</a> and common cause with many <a style="color: #579eb6" href="paladin.html">paladins</a>, but they are most
              comfortable around <a style="color: #579eb6" href="wizard.html">wizards</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="ranger.html">rangers</a>, and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="druid.html">druids</a>. Although elves
              are as religious as any other race, elf paragons often mistrust
              <a style="color: #579eb6" href="cleric.html">clerics'</a> reliance on divine guidance, and heavily armored warriors
              have an approach to combat that elf paragons sometimes have a hard
              time appreciating.

            <p>
              <b>Abilities:</b> Agility and physical grace are hallmarks of the
              elf race, and a high Dexterity score helps an elf paragon avoid
              blows in combat and make more accurate ranged attacks. Dexterity
              can even (after the selection of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#weapon-finesse">Weapon Finesse</a> feat) aid in
              melee combat. A high Intelligence score allows an elf paragon to
              access a broader selection of skills, and a high Wisdom is
              important for some of the class's most important class skills.

              Class Features
            </h6>
            <p>
              All of the following are class features of the elf paragon class.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Elf paragons are proficient
              with all simple weapons, rapiers, longswords, shortbows, and
              longbows. Elf paragons are proficient with light armor, but not
              with shields.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Spells per Day:</b> At 2nd and 3rd level, an elf paragon gains
              new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in <a style="color: #579eb6" href="wizard.html">wizard</a>.
              She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that
              class would have gained (bonus metamagic feats, and so on). This
              essentially means that she adds the level of elf paragon to her
              level in wizard, then determines spells per day and caster level
              accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              If an elf paragon has no levels in wizard, this class feature has
              no effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="elf-paragon-elfsight"></a><b>Elfsight (Ex):</b> An elf paragon has exceptional visual
              acuity. Her racial bonus on <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#search">Search</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#spot">Spot</a> checks increases to
              +4. In addition, an elf paragon's low-light vision increases in
              range, allowing her to see three times as far as a human in
              starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor
              illumination.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="elf-paragon-resist-enchantments"></a><b>Resist Enchantments (Ex):</b> An elf paragon's racial bonus on
              saves against enchantment spells or effects increases by 2.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="elf-paragon-weapon-focus"></a><b>Weapon Focus (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, an elf paragon gains
              <a style="color: #579eb6" href="featsAll.html#weapon-focus">Weapon Focus</a> as a bonus feat. This feat must apply to either the
              rapier, longsword, shortsword, shortbow, longbow, composite
              shortbow, or composite longbow.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="elf-paragon-ability-boost"></a><b>Ability Boost (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, an elf paragon's
              Intelligence score increases by 2 points.

              Curious, intelligent, and likable, gnomes move easily through the
              societies and communities of other races. They enjoy a strong
              sense of loyalty to clan as well as the pull of new experiences
              offered by adventure. While these sometimes opposing motivations
              get some adventuring gnomes into trouble with family and clan,
              gnome paragons successfully blend both aspects of their race's
              nature. They serve as an example to others of how to promote and
              protect their community and clan while at the same time constantly
              searching the world for new and interesting opportunities.
            <p>
              <a id="gnome-paragon-adventures"></a><b>Adventures:</b> Gnome paragons adventure for the sake of
              discovery. They are curious and social individuals who can balance
              the demands of clan life with the joys of travel. Many gnome
              paragons blend their love of adventure with their duties to their
              clans by traveling and adventuring only during the summer months,
              returning in the autumn to their homes with news and skills
              learned during their travels.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="gnome-paragon-characteristics"></a><b>Characteristics:</b> Personable and curious, gnome paragons get
              along well in most communities, and they often provide a lively
              diversion wherever they go. Socially adept enough to know when
              their questions are wearing thin on their companions, gnome
              paragons nonetheless share their race's propensity for long
              strings of seemingly unrelated questions. This lighthearted
              behavior does not make them silly or weak, however; they are calm
              and likable in most situations, but determined and sometimes
              ruthless when protecting their friends and communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="gnome-paragon-alignment"></a><b>Alignment:</b> Gnome paragons are almost always good-aligned,
              with an equal balance of neutrality and chaos represented among
              the class.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="gnome-paragon-religion"></a><b>Religion:</b> Seldom religious themselves, gnome paragons are
              curious about religion and sincerely interested in the traditions
              of others. Those gnome paragons who do follow the teachings of one
              deity almost always worship a deity of knowledge or travel, the
              two disciplines that appeal most to the paragon's inquisitive
              nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="gnome-paragon-background"></a><b>Background:</b> Gnome paragons have incredibly varied
              backgrounds, much more so than the paragons of any other race
              except humans. They travel unusual and individual paths toward
              achieving their status as paragons, and most do so without
              realizing it. Burgeoning gnome paragons are so involved in the
              nature of their race and the love of new experience that they
              seldom realize they champion and demonstrate the greatest virtues
              of gnomekind.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="gnome-paragon-races"></a><b>Races:</b> Gnome paragons, like many other gnomes, prefer the
              company of dwarves over that of other races�but they enjoy social
              interaction with nearly any race. Gnome paragons are sincerely
              interested in experiencing what other races have to offer, making
              their company appealing to all but the most reclusive or staid
              individuals. Gnome paragons are even willing to interact with
              monstrous creatures, and good-aligned individuals from normally
              evil races find themselves welcome in gnome communities due to the
              efforts of gnome paragons.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="gnome-paragon-other-classes"></a><b>Other Classes:</b> Gnome paragons enjoy adventuring with
              members of any class. They benefit greatly from fighting beside or
              behind a larger, stronger melee combatant. They are adept in
              social situations that many classes find taxing. And they provide
              minor spellcasting support that benefits many combinations of
              allies. Gnome paragons even get along well with the paragons of
              other races, finding the magnified characteristics of racial
              paragons both entertaining and instructive.

            <p>
              <b>Abilities:</b> Charisma determines the effectiveness of a gnome
              paragon's limited spellcasting ability, and it is important to the
              social skills in which the class excels. Dexterity can help gnome
              paragons survive combat with larger, stronger foes, and help make
              them more effective as ranged combatants, while Constitution can
              make them more able to withstand the physical dangers of
              adventuring.

            <p>
              All of the following are class features of the gnome paragon
              class.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Gnome paragons are proficient
              with all simple weapons and with light armor.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Spells per Day:</b> At 2nd and 3rd level, a gnome paragon gains
              new spells per day and spells known as if he had also gained a
              level in <a style="color: #579eb6" href="bard.html">bard</a>. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a
              character of that class would have gained (bard class features,
              and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of gnome
              paragon to his level in bard, then determines spells per day,
              spells known, and caster level accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a gnome paragon has no levels in bard, this class feature has
              no effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="gnome-paragon-illusion-aptitude"></a><b>Illusion Aptitude (Ex):</b> A gnome paragon may add his class
              level to his caster level to determine the effects of any illusion
              spells he casts, including those gained as innate abilities of the
              gnome race. This bonus stacks with the extra spellcasting levels
              gained from the gnome paragon's spells per day entry (see above).
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, a 2nd-level wizard/3rd-level gnome paragon's caster
              level is 2nd for most wizard spells but 5th for wizard spells of
              the illusion school (and 4th for his innate spell-like abilities
              <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsDtoE.html#dancing-lights">dancing lights</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsFtoG.html#ghost-sound">ghost sound</a>, and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#prestidigitation">prestidigitation</a>). A 3rd-level
              bard/2nd-level gnome paragon's caster level is 4th for most bard
              spells but 6th for bard spells of the illusion school.
            </p>
            <p>

              can cast; it does not give him access to higher-level spells or

              Half-dragons are a diverse lot. Their dragon parents differ in
              attitudes and abilities depending on their kind, and the magical
              nature of dragons means that their other parent can be nearly
              anything. This diversity might seem to preclude the idea of a
              half-dragon paragon, but the overwhelming strength of the dragon
              heritage makes such paragons possible. Half-dragon paragons are
              defined in large part by the nature of their dragon parent, making
              a half-gold dragon much different from a half-red dragon � although
              both are gifted with extraordinary physical abilities and force of
              personality.
            <p>
              <a id="half-dragon-paragon-adventures"></a><b>Adventures:</b> Half-dragon paragons adventure for the obvious
              reasons of gaining wealth, power, or the other trappings of
              worldly success. Some are motivated to adventure to gain stature
              in their dragon parents' eyes or (in the case of many chromatic
              half-dragons) to gain the power necessary to protect themselves
              from their powerful dragon parents. Metallic half-dragons might be
              motivated to adventure to fulfill some noble quest or to undertake
              some journey of selfdiscovery, but chromatic half-dragons
              typically adventure for more selfish reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-dragon-paragon-characteristics"></a><b>Characteristics:</b> Half-dragons have an innate
              self-confidence that borders on arrogance � or crosses that border.
              Many individuals, of course, manage to rein in their arrogance
              around other races. Half-dragons follow the nature of their dragon
              parents much more often than that of their other parent, being
              kind or cruel as their dragon parent would be.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-dragon-paragon-alignment"></a><b>Alignment:</b> A half-dragon paragon generally follows the
              precepts and beliefs of her dragon parent, adopting the alignment
              and beliefs typical of that dragon parent's kind. There are those
              who rebel against their dragon parents and their parents'
              alignments, though. Instances of this behavior are more common
              among chromatic half-dragon paragons � but the evil dragons are
              often keen to destroy rebellious offspring. As a result,
              half-dragon paragons with unexpected alignments are rare among
              both metallic and chromatic varieties.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-dragon-paragon-religion"></a><b>Religion:</b> Half-dragon paragons rarely gravitate to
              religion; they're simply too self-involved to study the tenets of
              an organized religion. Many metallic half-dragons have no trouble
              making common cause with good-aligned clerics, however, and those
              who multiclass as paladins find that their noble natures blend
              well with the religion behind the paladin's code. Chromatic
              half-dragons, however, take a different tack, and many have
              benefited from the adulation of cults of lesser creatures
              dedicated to the worship of dragons. Whether they believe in their
              own divinity or not, evil dragons and half-dragons have no trouble
              duping and using those they see as beneath themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-dragon-paragon-background"></a><b>Background:</b> Strife and tragedy haunts chromatic half-dragon
              paragons just as love and a powerful protective presence shelters
              most metallic half-dragon paragons. A half-dragon paragon masters
              the skills of combat and adventuring out of necessity: Chromatic
              half-dragons must do so to gain some measure of protection or
              usefulness in the eyes of their powerful and cruel parents, and
              metallic half-dragons must do so to ensure that they do not become
              a vehicle through which others can take advantage of their noble
              parents.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-dragon-paragon-races"></a><b>Races:</b> Just as it dominates many other aspects of their
              lives, the innate confidence of half-dragon paragons shapes their
              view of other races. Half-dragons have a grudging respect for any
              who achieve greatness or prove themselves capable. But they
              maintain, to one degree or another, that anything that one can
              accomplish could be more easily accomplished if one were a
              half-dragon.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-dragon-paragon-other-classes"></a><b>Other Classes:</b> Because half-dragon paragons are blessed
              with substantial physical prowess, they tend to favor martial
              classes for multiclass options, and they have a higher regard for
              those who stand toe-to-toe with their enemies than for those who
              strike from afar. Although they admit that spellcasters can indeed
              grow mighty, they scoff at sorcerers, who owe their abilities to a
              mere trace of dragon ancestry.

              Although their mixed heritage rarely leaves half-elves embittered,
              many can find it difficult to call any community home. Humans and
              elves move through the world at very different paces and have
              extremely divergent tastes and habits, and neither quite fits a
              half-elf's innate preferences and attitudes. Halfelf paragons are
              those half-elves who reconcile these two sides of their nature and
              create an outlook that is wholly their own.
            <p>
              <a id="half-elf-paragon-adventures"></a><b>Adventures:</b> Half-elf paragons turn to adventuring for many
              reasons. Like members of any other class, many half-elf paragons
              adventure out of a simple desire for wealth, fame, or personal
              power. Because they are less attached to their communities than
              any other racial paragons (except perhaps for half-orcs), half-elf
              paragons rarely adventure to defend a home or further the
              interests of their race as a whole�instead, they often turn to
              adventuring as a means of finding their own place in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-elf-paragon-charactersistics"></a><b>Characteristics:</b> Half-elf paragons are a strange blend of
              curiosity and introspection. Half-elf paragons share the adaptable
              and inventive nature of their human parents with the refined
              senses and penchant for long, careful thought of their elf
              parents. Half-elf paragons are accomplished in both combat and
              stealth, and one often fills the role of scout or sentry in an
              adventuring party. Although it might seem to some that half-elf
              paragons lack focus, it is in a half-elf paragon's nature to fit
              her skills to the job at hand - and it is precisely her blend of
              skills that makes her capable of overcoming a wide array of
              challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-elf-paragon-alignment"></a><b>Alignment:</b> Half-elf paragons can be of any alignment, but
              most are chaotic and many are good. Freedom appeals to
              half-elves � perhaps, because they seldom have firm roots in a
              community, they find free choice and an open mind appealing.
              Although a half-elf's mixed ancestry is occasionally the result of
              an evil act, most half-elves exhibit the better aspects of their
              parent races' natures.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-elf-paragon-religion"></a><b>Religion:</b> Half-elf paragons tend to have extreme views on
              religion. Many shy away from it, seeking clerics and other
              servants of the gods only when need arises. A few gravitate toward
              religion, devoting themselves to a specific deity, an entire
              pantheon, or a philosophy. Such individuals find, in religion, the
              sense of belonging and purpose they don't get from their
              communities. Half-elf paragons who are drawn to religion often
              follow a deity of travel or freedom, finding the road and its
              endless challenges a compelling change from their homes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-elf-paragon-background"></a><b>Background:</b> The background of most half-elves, paragons
              included, tends to be one of extremes. Either a half-elf finds
              unusual acceptance and peace throughout her life, or she finds
              herself faced with near-constant upheaval and turmoil. Whatever
              their individual circumstances, adult half-elves rarely have
              strong ties to a place or community, and many choose a life of
              adventure and travel.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-elf-paragon-races"></a><b>Races:</b> Half-elf paragons are reserved in their views on
              other races. They get along well with members of most races, but
              the two races to which they are closest � humans and elves � are also
              the two most likely to provoke strong feelings from a half-elf
              paragon. Events in an individual half-elf paragon's life are
              likely to shape attitudes about one or the other of those
              races � usually for ill.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-elf-paragon-other-classes"></a><b>Other Classes:</b> Half-elf paragons are among the most open
              minded adventurers to be found. They value the skills of other
              classes equally, although their elven heritage gives them a slight
              preference for wizards and rangers. Because half-elf paragons
              often multiclass as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="rogue.html">rogues</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="ranger.html">rangers</a>, they share some of the
              predilections of those classes, valuing less subtle companions
              when battle is joined but occasionally finding them a nuisance
              when stealth is called for.

            <p>
              All of the following are class features of the half-elf paragon
              class.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Half-elf paragons are
              proficient with all simple weapons and with light armor.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Spells per Day:</b> At 2nd level, a half-elf paragon gains new
              spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had
              also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before
              adding the level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a
              character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item
              creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on). This
              essentially means that she adds the level of half-elf paragon to
              the level in the spellcasting class, then determines spells per
              day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a character had more than one spellcasting class before she
              became a half-elf paragon, she must decide to which class she adds
              the level of half-elf paragon. If a half-elf paragon has no levels
              in a spellcasting class, this class feature has no effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Bonus Feat (Ex):</b> At 1st level, a half-elf paragon gains a
              bonus feat. The character must meet the feat's prerequisites
              normally.
            </p>
            <p>

              half-elves can take levels in more than one racial paragon class.
              After gaining at least one level as a half-elf paragon, a
              character can take either <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#elf-paragon">elf paragon</a> levels or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#human-paragon">human paragon</a>
              levels (but not both).

            <p>
              <a id="half-elf-paragon-elven-vision"></a><b>Elven Vision (Ex):</b> At 1st level, a half-elf paragon's
              visual acuity improves to match that of an elf's. A half-elf
              paragon's racial bonus on <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#search">Search</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#spot">Spot</a> checks increases to +2.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-elf-paragon-persuasion"></a><b>Persuasion (Ex):</b> A 2nd level half-elf paragon's racial
              bonus on <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#siplomacy">Diplomacy</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#gather-information">Gather information</a> checks increases to +3.
              She gains a +2 racial bonus on all other <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsCha.html">Charisma-based skills</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-elf-paragon-ability-boost"></a><b>Ability Boost (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, a half-elf paragon
              increases one ability score of her choice by 2 points.

              Half-orc paragons differ from other racial paragons in that they
              rarely have large populations of other half-orcs promoting and
              supporting their views of their race. Rather, most half-orc
              paragons find the strength to champion their heritage by
              overcoming the challenges of a unique and sometimes isolating
              background. Powerful warriors, half-orc paragons combine the
              innate ferocity of their orc heritage with the quick thinking and

              <a id="half-orc-paragon-adventures"></a><b>Adventures:</b> Half-orc paragons adventure to see the world,
              look for a home, search for fame and power, or simply wander for
              wandering's sake. With fewer connections to their race as a whole
              than other racial paragons, half-orc paragons are likely to remain
              active adventurers for long periods of time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Successful half-orc paragon adventurers often attract others of
              their race. These like-minded half-orcs seek acceptance in the
              half-orc paragon's community, seek to become adventuring
              companions, or simply want to be followers.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-orc-paragon-characteristics"></a><b>Characteristics:</b> Half-orc paragons are as mixed in outlook
              as they are in ancestry. Most half-orc paragons come to identify
              strongly with one or the other of their parent races, and see
              themselves as the bridge between that race and other half-orcs.
              Many view themselves as gifted with strength and opportunities
              beyond those of either of their parent races.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-orc-paragon-alignment"></a><b>Alignment:</b> Half-orc paragons, like most orcs and half-orcs,
              tend toward a chaotic outlook. Some half-orc paragons give in to
              bitterness caused by the difficulties they encounter in
              communities of other races, but most look beyond that, drawing
              strength of character from the inequities they face.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-orc-paragon-religion"></a><b>Religion:</b> Half-orc paragons rarely have strong religious
              views. Although they respect the obvious power of the deities and
              their clerics, few half-orc paragons feel the call of a higher
              power � perhaps because they sit so clearly between two numerous and
              powerful races.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-orc-paragon-background"></a><b>Background:</b> Most half-orc paragons become champions of
              their race because they endure unusual circumstances involving
              both humans and orcs. Many who are born in areas of great conflict
              between the two races feel the constant pull of a mixed heritage.
              Often, it is travel away from such areas that crystallizes the
              paragon's view of his own race, allowing him to see the value and
              virtue in his own abilities and outlook.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-orc-paragon-races"></a><b>Races:</b> Half-orc paragons face challenges wherever they
              turn, for many races look on them with suspicion or view their
              orcish parentage as a taint. Most half-orc paragons form close
              friendships with only a few individuals. Because it is usually
              difficult for a half-orc to find friendship and trust, even among
              those of their own kind, half-orc paragons are all the more loyal
              to those who do become their close friends.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="half-orc-paragon-other-classes"></a><b>Other Classes:</b> Half-orc paragons understand the harsh life
              and ferocity of <a style="color: #579eb6" href="barbarian.html">barbarians</a>, particularly those paragons who hail
              from regions populated by barbarian tribes. Half-orc paragons
              admire classes that are proficient in battle, considering the
              practiced skills of a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="fighter.html">fighter</a> and the woods lore of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="ranger.html">ranger</a>
              equally valid choices for a warrior. Although half-orc paragons
              can admire the effects of powerful spells wielded by <a style="color: #579eb6" href="cleric.html">clerics</a>,
              <a style="color: #579eb6" href="wizard.html">wizards</a>, and other spellcasters, they often look on members of
              such classes with suspicion or even contempt, seeing magic as
              little more than a cover for physical weakness.

            <p>
              <b>Abilities:</b> Strength is important to half-orc paragons
              because of its role in combat, and several half-orc paragon skills
              are based on Strength. Dexterity and Constitution are valued
              because of their roles in combat, and a high Constitution also
              allows a half-orc paragon to rage for longer periods of time.

              <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Half-orc paragons are

              armor and medium armor.

            <p>
              <a id="half-orc-paragon-dividen-ancestry"></a><b>Divided Ancestry (Ex):</b> Unlike other racial paragons,
              half-orcs can take levels in more than one racial paragon class.
              After gaining at least one level as a half-orc paragon, a
              character can take either <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#orc-paragon">orc paragon</a> levels or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#human-paragon">human paragon</a>
              levels (but not both).

            <p>
              <a id="half-orc-paragon-monstrous-mien"></a><b>Monstrous Mien (Ex):</b> Half-orc paragons can channel their

            <p>
              <a id="half-orc-paragon-rage"></a><b>Rage (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, a half-orc paragon comes to
              understand and draw upon the natural ferocity that courses through
              his blood. He gains the ability to fly into a screaming blood
              frenzy once per day (or one additional time per day, if he already
              has a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="barbarian.html#barbarian-rage">rage</a> ability). The effect of this ability is identical with
              the effect of a barbarian's rage ability. If a half-orc paragon
              has improved rage abilities (such as the barbarian class features
              <a style="color: #579eb6" href="barbarian.html#barbarian-greater-rage">greater rage</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="barbarian.html#barbarian-indomitable-will">indomitable will</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="barbarian.html#barbarian-tireless-rage">tireless rage</a>, or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="barbarian.html#barbarian-mighty-rage">mighty rage</a>),

              Clever and capable, halfling paragons love travel, and they embody
              the curiosity and easygoing ways of the halfling people. Despite
              their curiosity and good-natured outlook, halfling paragons are
              the most capable members of their race. They are survivors,
              cunning and resourceful enough to survive in a world filled with
              large, dangerous creatures. When halfling paragons travel through
              communities and countries populated by other races, they are quick
              to make friends and often end up at the center of traveling or
              adventuring groups.
            <p>
              <a id="halfling-paragon-adventures"></a><b>Adventures:</b> Filled with the wanderlust of the halfling
              race, halfling paragons see adventuring as a natural extension of
              their travels through the world. In fact, it's unlikely that a
              halfling paragon thinks of herself as being on an adventure at any
              time, even in the middle of a trapfilled dungeon. For a character
              with a lust for excitement and discovery, what could be a more
              natural place to visit than a dungeon or ancient ruin?
            </p>
            <p>
              Occasionally halfling paragons embody the worst of their race's
              characteristics, using their stealth abilities and their natural
              cunning to steal from other races � races they consider dupes and
              fools.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="halfling-paragon-characteristics"></a><b>Characteristics:</b> Exasperated adventuring companions claim
              that halfling paragons invented curiosity. With their small size
              and uncanny stealth, halfling paragons can go nearly anywhere
              undetected. Remaining undetected, however, is rarely any fun.
              halfling paragons enjoy the benefits of their small size, and many
              secretly wonder how bigger races can ever do anything quietly.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="halfling-paragon-alignment"></a><b>Alignment:</b> Most halfling paragons are chaotic good. They
              love freedom, and their approach to life is in many ways carefree
              and unpredictable. While most halflings tend toward neutrality
              over chaos, a halfling paragon embodies the race's curiosity and
              love of travel.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="halfling-paragon-religion"></a><b>Religion:</b> Halfling paragons favor a variety of deities.
              Some flit from religion to religion carelessly; they find new
              ideas compelling and often investigate the tenets of one religion
              for a while before moving on to another. In this way, halfling
              paragons amass a few scattered bits of philosophy culled from
              several different religions into their own happy amalgam. Halfling
              paragons who remain dedicated to one deity or philosophy almost
              always multiclass as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="cleric.html">clerics</a> devoted to a god of travel.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="halfling-paragon-background"></a><b>Background:</b> A halfling paragon learns her skills while
              traveling with her clan. Although she may be born to a nomadic
              people, even the clan's travel eventually seems too infrequent,
              the pace too slow. The wanderlust of the halfling race flows
              through her, and eventually she sets off on her own, outpacing the
              slow-moving wagons of her people. Many halfling paragons
              multiclass as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="rogue.html">rogues</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="ranger.html">rangers</a>, and their skills develop while
              sneaking around in large cities or stalking game through deep
              wilderness.

            <p>
              <a id="halfling-paragon-races"></a><b>Races:</b> Halfling paragons travel, and they never seem to
              tire out. Because they spend so much time in the communities of
              other races, they strive to get along well with everyone. They are
              adept, as most halflings are, at fitting into the communities of
              others, although they rarely stay long.

              Halfling paragons enjoy a mixed lot of traveling companions � too
              many members of just one race makes for boring company. Although
              open-minded in the extreme, halfling paragons can occasionally
              find dwarves too dour and serious for their tastes. halfling
              paragons particularly enjoy the company of gnomes.

              <a id="halfling-paragon-other-classes"></a><b>Other Classes:</b> Halfling paragons regard other classes with
              a mixture of relief and frustration. They are happy to stand
              behind <a style="color: #579eb6" href="fighter.html">fighters</a> and members of other physically powerful classes
              when monsters charge up to do battle, and they are grateful when a
              spellcaster's abilities help them sneak past an opponent or heal
              their wounds. But few classes can match the halfling paragon's
              capability for stealth, and more often than not it is members of
              those other classes that get the halfling paragon into a fight in
              the first place. Halfling paragons get along best with other
              stealthy characters, particularly <a style="color: #579eb6" href="rogue.html">rogues</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="ranger.html">rangers</a>, and many
              multiclass between the two classes.

            <p>
              <b>Abilities:</b> Dexterity is important to halfling paragons
              because it helps them avoid the attacks of larger foes and
              increases their accuracy with thrown weapons and slings, their
              favorite forms of attack. Because halfling paragons value skill
              and subtlety, a high Intelligence can help them a great deal.
              Charisma is important to many of the halfling paragon's class
              skills.

              Human inventors, explorers, and others who push the boundaries of
              knowledge and experience may become human paragons. They turn
              adversity into opportunity by finding new ways to apply their
              skills, discovering new techniques to solve problems, and
              challenging entropy by constantly seeking out ventures they have
              not yet mastered. Humans, and the paragons who rise from among
              them, balance strength with agility and temper intellect with
              intuition.
            <p>
              <a id="human-paragon-adventures"></a><b>Adventures:</b> Adventure occupies much of a human paragon's
              time. Whether impulsive or carefully studious, a human paragon
              searches almost constantly for the new and unexplored. Few,
              however, think of themselves as pioneers or inventors. They see
              themselves as naturally curious, deeming the intelligent and
              unusual way in which they use their skills to be the norm rather
              than an exception. Curiosity and wanderlust are easily the two
              most common motivations for undertaking adventures, but human
              paragons may find themselves on adventures as a result of a quest
              or some other necessary duty.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="human-paragon-characteristics"></a><b>Characteristics:</b> Human paragons are inventiveness
              personified. They are adaptable and capable of using their skills
              in a broad variety of situations. Perhaps because they are capable
              in such a wide range of situations, human paragons tend to dislike
              repetition and crave variety. They seldom pass up a chance to
              indulge in a new experience, and a new challenge is much more
              likely to excite them than a lingering goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              If human paragons have a downfall, it is that they see themselves
              capable of overcoming any challenge or inventing a solution for
              any problem. When asked who would be best for a task, a human
              paragon almost always chooses himself � not out of overconfidence or
              egotism, but because he has learned through success after success
              that when backed into a corner, he'll almost always find a way
              out.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="human-paragon-alignment"></a><b>Alignment:</b> Human paragons have few tendencies in alignment.
              Perhaps more are attracted to chaos over law, although those who
              become devoted to a religion or cause seem to gravitate toward
              lawful deities or philosophies.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="human-paragon-religion"></a><b>Religion:</b> Humans are as varied in their beliefs as they are
              in every other aspect of their lives, and human paragons are no
              exception. Many human paragons dabble in religion, learning a bit
              of one doctrine, following another deity for a brief time, and so
              on. Although these individuals seldom stay with one belief system
              for long, they become quite well versed in religion over time.
              While it's more common to find human paragons with only these
              surface attachments to religion, some human paragons develop a
              passion for worship that fuses seamlessly with their views of
              humanity, resulting in zealotry. In almost every case, these human
              paragons follow lawful deities and multiclass as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="cleric.html">clerics</a> or
              <a style="color: #579eb6" href="paladin.html">paladins</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="human-paragon-background"></a><b>Background:</b> Although there is no single common background
              for human paragons, many share some common characteristics. They
              often arise from situations in which they have many opportunities
              to learn, either from parents, an accepting community, or even a
              monastery filled with learned <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monk.html">monks</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="cleric.html">clerics</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="human-paragon-races"></a><b>Races:</b> Human paragons are open and accepting, embodying the
              best aspects of humanity's flexibility and tolerance. Human
              paragons usually delight in poking gentle fun at the foibles of
              other races, finding their extremes of behavior amusing. They also
              find much to admire in other races, including the stoic fortitude
              of the dwarves, the beauty and grace of the elves, and the
              curiosity and inventiveness of the halflings. In truth, human
              paragons are closer in attitude to halflings than any other
              race � both suffer (or benefit) from more than a touch of
              wanderlust.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="human-paragon-other-classes"></a><b>Other Classes:</b> Human paragons are widely accepting of other
              classes. They value the presence of <a style="color: #579eb6" href="fighter.html">fighters</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="ranger.html">rangers</a>, and other
              skilled combatants, knowing that they are more likely to survive a
              battle when teamed with such characters. They also understand the
              value of knowledge, and they regard spellcasters with a bit of
              awe. <a style="color: #579eb6" href="rogue.html">Rogues</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="bard.html">bards</a>, closest in ability (if not in spirit) to
              human paragons, usually have skills that overlap the paragon's in
              several areas, allowing the paragon to diversify his learning
              rather than become overly specialized.

            <p>
              <b>Abilities:</b> Skilled and quick to adapt, human paragons
              benefit from a high Intelligence. But they are also often at the
              forefront of humanity's wars, making Strength, Dexterity, and
              Constitution important for their respective roles in combat.

              Class Skills
            </h6>
            <p>
              The human paragon can choose any ten <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html">skills</a> as class skills.
              (<a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> skills must be selected individually.)

              Class Features
            </h6>
            <p>
              All of the following are class features of the human paragon.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Human paragons are proficient
              with all simple weapons and with light armor. In addition, a human
              paragon is proficient with any one martial weapon of his choice.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Spells per Day:</b> At 2nd and 3rd level, a human paragon gains
              new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had
              also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before
              adding the level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a
              character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item
              creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on). This
              essentially means that he adds the level of human paragon to the
              level in the spellcasting class, then determines spells per day,
              spells known, and caster level accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a character had more than one spellcasting class before he
              became a human paragon, he must decide to which class he adds each
              level of human paragon. If a human paragon has no levels in a
              spellcasting class, this class feature has no effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="human-paragon-adaptive-learning"></a><b>Adaptive Learning (Ex):</b> At 1st level, a human paragon can
              designate any one of his human paragon class skills as an adaptive
              skill. This skill is treated as a class skill in all respects for
              all classes that character has levels in, both current and future.
              For example, if a human paragon chooses <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#spot">Spot</a> as an adaptive skill,
              he treats Spot as a class skill for all future class levels he
              gains, even if it is not normally a class skill for the class in
              question.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Bonus Feat (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, a human paragon gains a
              bonus feat. Due to the varied talents and adaptable nature of
              humans, this feat can be any feat for which the human paragon is
              qualified (he is not restricted to a special list of bonus feats).
              The character must meet the prerequisites for the bonus feat
              normally.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="human-paragon-ability-boost"></a><b>Ability Boost (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, a human paragon increases
              one ability score of his choice by 2 points.

              Aggressive, brutal, and often at odds with the other humanoid
              races, orcs view war and hatred as their right. They have a deep
              and nearly endless enmity for elves and dwarves, having battled
              both races for countless generations. Like members of other
              paragon classes, orc paragons embody the best of their race,
              combining the strength and confidence of their people with
              intelligent observation and a willingness to temper risk with
              calculation.
            <p>
              <a id="orc-paragon-adventures"></a><b>Adventures:</b> Orcs undertake adventures for many reasons,
              although most do so to gain wealth or power. For orcs,
              "adventuring" often means raiding the cities and towns of other
              humanoid races, rather than exploring lost tombs or slaying
              powerful monsters. Despite this tendency, orcs can occasionally be
              found accompanying small groups of adventurers on quests of great
              significance. Some find their own culture stifling, and wish to
              rise above its cruel savagery, while others seek to learn the
              fighting techniques of other races to grow mighty themselves,
              hoping to become a champion of the orc race.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="orc-paragon-characteristics"></a><b>Characteristics:</b> Mean and foul-tempered, orcs have many
              characteristics that other humanoid races find offensive or
              repulsive. Most orcs are savage and cruel. Orc paragons, however,
              ternper this behavior with keener powers of observation and a
              slightly more tolerant view of other races and cultures. Orc
              paragons are much more curious than other members of their race,
              and many come to see learning as the key to advancing the orc
              cause.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="orc-paragon-alignment"></a><b>Alignment:</b> Orc paragons are nearly always chaotic, but a
              rare few see a greater future for orcs as a race if they can
              become more orderly and organized. These orc paragons, arguably
              the most forward-thinking members of their warlike race, favor
              neutral alignments.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="orc-paragon-religion"></a><b>Religion:</b> Although orcs as a race tend to follow the
              teachings of brutal and savage deities or worship powerful evil
              creatures, orc paragons are seldom deeply religious. Those who
              rise to leadership positions in their tribes don't hesitate to use
              religious beliefs as a tool to shape the tribe members to their
              desired ends, but they rarely possess strong beliefs themselves.
              The exceptions to this general statement can be extremely
              dangerous, however, and sometimes raise great hosts in the name of
              some powerful orc god.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="orc-paragon-background"></a><b>Background:</b> Orc paragons gain their skills in the crucible
              that is orc culture. They prove their strength by defeating lesser
              members of their tribes and often earn leadership positions within
              their culture. Nearly all orc paragons eventually seek knowledge
              and skills from cultures beyond their own, striving to bring more
              potent forms of combat arid more sophisticated knowledge back to
              their tribes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="orc-paragon-races"></a><b>Races:</b> Orc paragons, like other orcs, hate and detest elves
              and dwarves above all other races. Orcs rarely view other races as
              anything more than potential prey for their raids and wars, but
              when necessary, orc paragons can suppress their aggressive nature
              and get along with other races.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="orc-paragon-other-classes"></a><b>Other Classes:</b> Orc paragons respect those with strength and
              physical power, especially <a style="color: #579eb6" href="barbarian.html">barbarians</a> and <a style="color: #579eb6" href="fighter.html">fighters</a>. <a style="color: #579eb6" href="ranger.html">Rangers</a> are
              more often opponents of orc paragons than allies, but even so the
              two classes share a grudging respect for each other's skills and
              martial proficiency. Orc paragons care little for arcane
              spellcasters, but quickly learn to value powerful <a style="color: #579eb6" href="wizard.html">wizards</a> and
              <a style="color: #579eb6" href="sorcerer.html">sorcerers</a> capable of taking down multiple foes with a single

              Tieflings are humans with traces of fiendish ancestry. Although
              tieflings are not as powerful or as potent as full-fledged
              half-fiends, their touch of fiendish blood does grant them
              significant bonuses to their physical and mental abilities as well
              as some minor resistances and spell-like abilities. Although a few
              tieflings manage to overcome their ancestry and remain good and
              trustworthy individuals, most tieflings follow the dark urges
              tugging at them, becoming selfish, cruel, and evil as they mature.
              Tiefling paragons, both good and evil, are those who most
              successfully come to terms with their family's history. The good
              ones see themselves as rising above their ancestry, while the evil
              ones embrace its power.
            <p>
              <a id="tiefling-paragon-adventures"></a><b>Adventures:</b> Tiefling paragons undertake adventures for the
              usual reasons of gaining wealth, prestige, or power. Evil
              tieflings, in particular, adventure to fulfill selfish desires � to
              gain powerful magic or find lost knowledge that will give them an
              advantage in some conflict. Good tiefling paragons typically
              adventure to prove their worth to a community, to stick with the
              few close companions they have managed to find, or simply to get
              away from the press of civilization.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="tiefling-paragon-characteristics"></a><b>Characteristics:</b> Tiefling paragons are stealthy, deceptive,
              and often selfish. Trusted by few, they in turn trust no one,
              knowing that, no matter their behavior, they'll likely be
              suspected of wrongdoing as soon as any problem arises in the
              community. Because of such hard lessons in dealing with other
              races, tiefling paragons are suspicious of kindness and almost
              never trust that a member of another race will remain loyal or
              friendly once the tiefling's ancestry is known. Many tiefling
              paragons, even those who aren't truly evil, have an appetite for
              cruelty that is difficult to suppress.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="tiefling-paragon-alignment"></a><b>Alignment:</b> Almost all tiefling paragons are evil. Those
              that are not must constantly struggle against thoughts of violence
              and corruption, seldom knowing the peace that many other
              goodaligned creatures take for granted.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="tiefling-paragon-religion"></a><b>Religion:</b> Most tiefling paragons steer clear of religion,
              knowing that many followers of good deities see it as their duty
              to expose or attack tieflings. Evil tiefling paragons involved
              with evil cults (typically dedicated to powerful fiends of some
              kind) are an exception.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="tiefling-paragon-background"></a><b>Background:</b> Tiefling paragons learn their skills while
              slipping quietly through the societies of other races. They
              frequently multiclass as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="rogue.html">rogues</a>, and often have similar
              backgrounds. A lucky few tiefling paragons have mentors and
              opportunities to learn in comfortable environments, but the vast
              majority must overcome the prejudices of those who fear the
              tiefling's ancestry, learning their skills among criminals and in
              back alleys.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tiefling paragons do not see themselves as fellows or champions of
              their race. Instead, if evil, they see themselves as champions of
              evil and representatives of their fiendish forefathers. Good
              tiefling paragons seek to absolve themselves of the reputation
              imposed upon them by their ancestry.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="tiefling-paragon-races"></a><b>Races:</b> Tiefling paragons have widely differing attitudes
              about the humanoid races, depending on alignment and their
              experiences in the communities of different races. Although they
              can get along in many societies, tiefling paragons prefer large
              human cities, where it's generally easier to conceal their
              ancestry. Tiefling paragons rarely have time for dwarves, mostly
              because dwarves are likely to be suspicious and critical of the
              tiefling's presence. Conversely, they empathize with the prejudice
              and difficulties that half-orcs face in many civilized communities
              and can form friendships based on this shared perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a id="tiefling-paragon-other-classes"></a><b>Other Classes:</b> Tiefling paragons are happy to work with
              members of other classes, provided that the tiefling can
              manipulate events to her own ends, make off with choice treasure
              at opportune moments, or gather information for later use. Evil
              tieflings, naturally, avoid the company of <a style="color: #579eb6" href="paladin.html">paladins</a>, but those
              tieflings who have dedicated themselves to good actually prefer
              the company of holy warriors, knowing that a paladin's word will
              go a long way toward assuring others that the tiefling can be
              trusted.

            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Abilities:</b> Because they tend to favor light armor, agile
              combat styles, and stealth whenever possible, Dexterity is
              extremely important to tiefling paragons. A high Intelligence
              grants the tiefling paragon access to more skills at each level,
              and a high Constitution helps compensate for the Hit Die lost
              because of the tiefling's level adjustment. Although tieflings
              take a racial penalty to Charisma, a good score in this ability
              can help those tiefling paragons who wish to conceal their nature
              from others and gain acceptance whenever their true nature becomes
              known.
