instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet

      <p>The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct
physical route to a specified destination, be it the way into or out of
a locale. The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a
maze spell. Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects
or creatures at a locale. The location must be on the same plane as you
are at the time of casting.</p>
      <p>The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction
that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at
appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take.
For example, the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the
proper word to bypass a glyph of warding. The spell ends when the
destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first.
Find the path can be used to remove the subject and its companions from
the effect of a maze spell in a single round.</p>

      <p><i>Holly Berry Bombs</i>: You turn as many as eight holly

      <p>Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon
deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points

either cold damage (if the shield protects against fire-based attacks)
or fire damage (if the shield protects against cold-based attacks). If

      <p>When casting fire trap, you select a point on the object as
the spell&rsquo;s center. When someone other than you opens the object,
a
fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the

harmed by this explosion.</p>
      <p>A fire trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding

      <p>You can use the fire trapped object without discharging it, as
can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when
cast. Attuning a fire trapped object to an individual usually involves
setting a password that you can share with friends.</p>

      <p>A fireball spell is an explosion of flame that detonates with
a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level
(maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area. Unattended objects
also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.</p>
      <p>You point your finger and determine the range (distance and
height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead
streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material
body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms
into the fireball at that point. (An early impact results in an early
detonation.) If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage,
such as through an arrow slit, you must &ldquo;hit&rdquo; the opening
with a ranged
touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates
prematurely.</p>
      <p>The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in
the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead,
gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an
interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may
continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at
the barrier just as any other spell effect does.</p>

      <p>A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from
your hand. You wield this bladelike beam as if it were a scimitar.
Attacks with the flame blade are melee touch attacks. The blade deals
1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10).
Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to
the damage. A flame blade can ignite combustible materials such as
parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.</p>
      <p>The spell does not function underwater.</p>

      <p>A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point
and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this
movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it
enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals
2d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex
save negates that damage. A flaming sphere rolls over barriers less
than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and
illuminates the same area as a torch would.</p>
      <p>The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move
action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can
be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its
size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and
so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside
unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A flaming sphere
winks out if it exceeds the spell&rsquo;s range.</p>

      <p>The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if it
wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load).
It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its
maneuverability is good. Using a fly spell requires only as much
concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells
normally. The subject of a fly spell can <a
 href="specialAttacks.html#charge" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">charge</a>
but not run, and it
cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it
wears.</p>
      <p>Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still
aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per
round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time,
it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6
points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell
effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the fly
spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.</p>

is 2 gallons.) The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at
all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell
range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal
speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant
interval of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of
existence when the spell duration expires. The disk also winks out if
you move beyond range or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away
from the surface beneath it. When the disk winks out, whatever it was

door and teleport), plane shifting, astral travel, ethereal travel, and
all summoning spells. Such effects simply fail automatically.</p>
      <p>In addition, it damages entering creatures whose alignments
are different from yours. The effect on those attempting to enter the
warded area is based on their alignment relative to yours (see below).
A creature inside the area when the spell is cast takes no damage
unless it exits the area and attempts to reenter, at which time it is
affected as normal.</p>

      <p>When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive
warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to

(via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger
befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay. The

      <p>Freezing sphere creates a frigid globe of cold energy that
streaks from your fingertips to the location you select, where it
explodes in a 10-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage
per caster level (maximum 15d6) to each creature in the area. An
elemental (water) creature instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per
caster level (maximum 15d8).</p>
      <p>If the freezing sphere strikes a body of water or a liquid
that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it
freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100
square feet (a 10- foot square) per caster level (maximum 1,500 square
feet). This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that were
swimming on the surface of frozen water become trapped in the ice.
Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature
must make a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 25 <a

Artist</a> check to do
so.</p>
      <p>You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the
spell, if you wish. Treat this as a touch spell for which you are
holding the charge. You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per
level, at the end of which time the freezing sphere bursts centered on
you (and you receive no saving throw to resist its effect). Firing the
globe in a later round is a standard action.</p>

      <p>The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and
translucent. Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes
worthless, though its size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor
bonuses from force effects still apply. The subject gains <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#damage-reduction">damage

can&rsquo;t attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or

components while in gaseous form. (This does not rule out the use of
certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats <a

the effects of wind, and it can&rsquo;t enter water or other liquid. It

      <p>Casting a gate spell has two effects. First, it creates an
interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane
you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either
direction.</p>
      <p>Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of
being through the gate.</p>
      <p>The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet
in diameter (caster&rsquo;s choice), oriented in the direction you
desire
when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is
a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when
casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted
instantly to the other side.</p>
      <p>A gate has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the
gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures
moving through it from the back are not.</p>
      <p><i>Planar Travel</i>: As a mode of planar travel, a gate spell
functions much like a plane shift spell, except that the gate opens
precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and
other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in
their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need
not join hands with you&mdash;anyone who chooses to step through the
portal
is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same
plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.</p>
      <p>You may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than
1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or
else the interplanar connection is severed.</p>
      <p><i>Calling Creatures</i>: The second effect of the gate spell
is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By
naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you
cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired
creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities
and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate,
although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the
spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport
the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).</p>
      <p>If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known
individual you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several
creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their
HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single
creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster
level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level
can&rsquo;t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be
controlled in
any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling
of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to
its home plane at any time.</p>
      <p>A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service
for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and
contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any
other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level
counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any
reward for the creature&rsquo;s help. The creature departs at the end
of the
spell.</p>
      <p>If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of
service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in
return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with
respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally
spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment
in &ldquo;livestock&rdquo; rather than in coin, which could involve
complications.)
Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to
your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised
reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return
to its own plane.</p>
      <p>Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your
being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master,
at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.</p>
      <p><i>Note</i>: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call
an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it
becomes a spell of that type.</p>
      <p><i>XP Cost</i>: 1,000 XP (only for the calling creatures
function).</p>

      <p>This spell functions similarly to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#lesser-geas">lesser geas</a>, except that it
affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.</p>
      <p>Instead of taking penalties to ability scores (as with lesser
geas), the subject takes 3d6 points of damage each day it does not
attempt to follow the geas/quest. Additionally, each day it must make a
Fortitude saving throw or become <a
 href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#sickened"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">sickened</a>. These effects end 24
hours

      <p>A remove curse spell ends a geas/quest spell only if its
caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. Break
enchantment does not end a geas/quest, but limited wish, miracle, and
wish do.</p>
      <p>Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as
geas, while clerics call the same spell quest.</p>

      <p>A lesser geas places a magical command on a creature to carry
out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity,
as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer Hit Dice and be
able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill
itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause
almost any other course of activity.</p>
      <p>The geased creature must follow the given instructions until
the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.</p>
      <p>If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the
recipient cannot complete through his own actions the spell remains in
effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient
can subvert some instructions:</p>
      <p>If the subject is prevented from obeying the lesser geas for
24 hours, it takes a &ndash;2 penalty to each of its ability scores.
Each
day, another &ndash;2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of &ndash;8.
No ability
score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score
penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the
lesser geas.</p>
      <p>A lesser geas (and all ability score penalties) can be ended
by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish.
Dispel magic does not affect a lesser geas.</p>

      <p>Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises,
recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type
of sound ghost sound creates when casting it and cannot thereafter
change the sound&rsquo;s basic character.</p>
      <p>The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can
produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum
twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or
running sounds can be created. The noise a ghost sound spell produces
can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of
rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans
running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen
humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty
humans.</p>

      <p>This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open
the warded area or object. A glyph of warding can guard a bridge or
passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.</p>
      <p>You set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature
entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking
a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the
magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger,
glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height
or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be set
with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your
religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level.
Glyphs respond to <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#invisible"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">invisible</a> creatures normally but
are not triggered by
those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast
on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three drawers, each can be
separately warded.</p>
      <p>When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing
lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any
shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the
spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible.</p>
      <p>Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as
physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. Mislead,
polymorph, and nondetection (and similar magical effects) can fool a
glyph, though nonmagical disguises and the like can&rsquo;t. Read magic
allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 <a
 href="skillsAll.html#spellcraft" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Spellcraft</a>
check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to
know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused,
what spell is stored).</p>
      <p><i>Note</i>: Magic traps such as glyph of warding are hard to
detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the <a
 href="skillsAll.html#search" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Search</a>
skill to find the
glyph and <a href="skillsAll.html#disable-device"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Disable Device</a> to thwart it. The
DC in each case is 25 +
spell level, or 28 for glyph of warding.</p>
      <p>Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the
intruder or activates a spell.</p>
      <p><i>Blast Glyph</i>: A blast glyph deals 1d8 points of damage
per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5
feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or
sonic (caster&rsquo;s choice, made at time of casting). Each creature
affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell
resistance applies against this effect.</p>
      <p><i>Spell Glyph</i>: You can store any harmful spell of 3rd
level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell
are based on your caster level at the time of casting the glyph. If the
spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area
or an amorphous effect the area or effect is centered on the intruder.
If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the
intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance operate as
normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the spell stored in
the glyph.</p>

      <p>A grease spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery
grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a
successful Reflex save or fall. This save is repeated on your turn each
round that the creature remains within the area. A creature can walk
within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 <a

check. Failure means it
can&rsquo;t move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall),
while
failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details).</p>
      <p>The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an
item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell,
while an object wielded or employed by a creature receives a Reflex
saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails,
the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in
each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased
item. A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +10

      <p>This powerful spell is primarily used to defend your
stronghold. The ward protects 200 square feet per caster level. The
warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire.
You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among
them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the
spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the
warded area.</p>
      <p><i>Fog</i>: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight,
including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has
concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away
have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use
sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.</p>
      <p><i>Arcane Locks</i>: All doors in the warded area are arcane
locked. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.</p>
      <p><i>Webs</i>: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These
strands are identical with those created by the web spell, except that
they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the
guards and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text
for web. Spell Resistance: No.</p>
      <p><i>Confusion</i>: Where there are choices in
direction&mdash;such as
a corridor intersection or side passage&mdash;a minor confusion-type
effect
functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are
going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This
is an enchantment, mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: None. Spell
Resistance: Yes.</p>
      <p><i>Lost Doors</i>: One door per caster level is covered by a
silent image to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: Will
disbelief (if interacted with). Spell Resistance: No.</p>
      <p>In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following
five magical effects.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a
simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the guards
and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A magic mouth in two places. Saving Throw: None. Spell
Resistance: No.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A stinking cloud in two places. The vapors appear in the
places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by
wind while the guards and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw: Fortitude
negates; see text for stinking cloud. Spell Resistance: No.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A gust of wind in one corridor or room. Saving Throw:
Fortitude negates. Spell Resistance: Yes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A suggestion in one place. You select an area of up to 5
feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area
receives the suggestion mentally. Saving Throw: Will negates. Spell
Resistance: Yes.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration
school. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful,
removes only that effect. A successful Mage&rsquo;s disjunction
destroys the
entire guards and wards effect.</p>

      <p>A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is <a

 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">knocked down</a> and
rolled 1d4x10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.
If flying, a Tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6x10 feet and
takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting.</p>
      <p>Small creatures are knocked <a

      <p>Medium creatures are unable to move forward against the force
of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6x5 feet.</p>
      <p>Large or larger creatures may move normally within a gust of
wind effect.</p>
      <p>A gust of wind can&rsquo;t move a creature beyond the limit of
its
range.</p>
      <p>Any creature, regardless of size, takes a &ndash;4 penalty on
ranged
attacks and <a href="skillsAll.html#listen"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Listen</a> checks in the area of a
gust of wind.</p>
      <p>The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles,
torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames,
such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to
extinguish those lights.</p>
      <p>In addition to the effects noted, a gust of wind can do
anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can
create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn
delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or
vapors to the edge of its range.</p>
      <p>Gust of wind can be made permanent with a permanency spell.</p>
