it&#8217;s important, you can distinguish between a bluff that fails because
the target doesn&#8217;t believe it and one that fails because it just asks
too much of the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on
its Sense Motive check because the bluff demands something risky, and
the Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn&#8217;t
so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A
target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff.</p>
      <p>A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as
you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or
believes something that you want it to believe. Bluff, however, is not
a suggestion spell. </p>
      <p>A bluff requires interaction between you and the target.
Creatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed.</p>
      <p><i>Feinting in Combat</i>: You can also use Bluff to mislead
an opponent in melee combat (so that it can&#8217;t dodge your next attack
effectively). To <a href="specialAttacks.html#feint"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">feint</a>, make a Bluff check
opposed by your target&#8217;s Sense Motive check, but in this case, the
target may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other
applicable modifiers. If your Bluff check result exceeds this special
Sense Motive check result, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus to
AC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This attack
must be made on or before your next turn.</p>
      <p>Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult
because it&#8217;s harder to read a strange creature&#8217;s body language; you
take a &#8211;4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of animal
Intelligence (1 or 2) it&#8217;s even harder; you take a &#8211;8 penalty. Against
a nonintelligent creature, it&#8217;s impossible.</p>
      <p>Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
      <p><i>Creating a Diversion to Hide</i>: You can use the Bluff
skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the
momentary diversion you need to attempt a <a href="skillsAll.html#hide"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Hide</a> check while people are
aware of you. This usage does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
      <p><i>Delivering a Secret Message</i>: You can use Bluff to get a
message across to another character without others understanding it.
The DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages,
especially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure
by 4 or less means you can&#8217;t get the message across. Failure by 5 or
more means that some false information has been implied or inferred.
Anyone listening to the exchange can make a Sense Motive check opposed
by the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your
message (see Sense Motive).</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. A Bluff check made as part of general
interaction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a full-round
action), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A
Bluff check made to feint in combat or create a diversion to hide is a
standard action. A Bluff check made to deliver a secret message doesn&#8217;t
take an action; it is part of normal communication.</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. Generally, a failed Bluff check in
social interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to try again
in the same circumstances, but you may retry freely on Bluff checks
made to feint in combat. Retries are also allowed when you are trying
to send a message, but you may attempt such a retry only once per
round. Each retry carries the same chance of miscommunication.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A ranger gains a bonus on Bluff checks when
using this skill against a favored enemy.</p>
      <p>The master of a snake familiar gains a +3 bonus on Bluff
checks.</p>
      <p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#persuasive"

      <h5>DIPLOMACY (CHA)</h5>
      <p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: You can change the attitudes of
others (nonplayer characters) with a successful Diplomacy check; see
the Influencing NPC Attitudes sidebar, below, for basic DCs. In
negotiations, participants roll opposed Diplomacy checks, and the
winner gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve situations when
two advocates or diplomats plead opposite cases in a hearing before a
third party.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Changing others&#8217; attitudes with Diplomacy
generally takes at least 1 full minute (10 consecutive full-round
actions). In some situations, this time requirement may greatly
increase. A rushed Diplomacy check can be made as a full-round action,
but you take a &#8211;10 penalty on the check.</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: Optional, but not recommended because
retries usually do not work. Even if the initial Diplomacy check
succeeds, the other character can be persuaded only so far, and a retry
may do more harm than good. If the initial check fails, the other
character has probably become more firmly committed to his position,
and a retry is futile.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A half-elf has a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy
checks.</p>
      <p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#negotiator"

      <p><i>Handle an Animal</i>: This task involves commanding an
animal to perform a task or trick that it knows. If the animal is
wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the
DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task
or trick on its next action.</p>
      <p><i>&#8220;Push&#8221; an Animal</i>: To push an animal means to get it to
perform a task or trick that it doesn&#8217;t know but is physically capable
of performing. This category also covers making an animal perform a
forced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep
cycles. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or
ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds,
the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.</p>
      <p><i>Teach an Animal a Trick</i>: You can teach an animal a
specific trick with one week of work and a successful Handle Animal
check against the indicated DC. An animal with an Intelligence score of
1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an
Intelligence score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible
tricks (and their associated DCs) include, but are not necessarily
limited to, the following.</p>
      <p>Attack (DC 20): The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may
point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and
it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids,
monstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to
attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and
aberrations) counts as two tricks.</p>
      <p>Come (DC 15): The animal comes to you, even if it normally
would not do so.</p>
      <p>Defend (DC 20): The animal defends you (or is ready to defend
you if no threat is present), even without any command being given.
Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other
character.</p>
      <p>Down (DC 15): The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise
backs down. An animal that doesn&#8217;t know this trick continues to fight
until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its
opponent is defeated.</p>
      <p>Fetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets something. If you do
not point out a specific item, the animal fetches some random object.</p>
      <p>Guard (DC 20): The animal stays in place and prevents others
from approaching.</p>
      <p>Heel (DC 15): The animal follows you closely, even to places
where it normally wouldn&#8217;t go.</p>
      <p>Perform (DC 15): The animal performs a variety of simple
tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.</p>
      <p>Seek (DC 15): The animal moves into an area and looks around
for anything that is obviously alive or animate.</p>
      <p>Stay (DC 15): The animal stays in place, waiting for you to
return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by,</p>
      <p>though it still defends itself if it needs to.</p>
      <p>Track (DC 20): The animal tracks the scent presented to it.
(This requires the animal to have the scent ability)</p>
      <p>Work (DC 15): The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy
load.</p>
      <p><i>Train an Animal for a Purpose</i>: Rather than teaching an
animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general
purpose. Essentially, an animal&#8217;s purpose represents a preselected set
of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or
heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all
tricks included in the training package. If the package includes more
than three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2.</p>
      <p>An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though
if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and
beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training
an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual
tricks does, but no less time. </p>
      <p>Combat Riding (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into
combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel.
Training an animal for combat riding takes six weeks. You may also
&#8220;upgrade&#8221; an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat riding
by spending three weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal
check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the
animal&#8217;s previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Warhorses and
riding dogs are already trained to bear riders into combat, and they
don&#8217;t require any additional training for this purpose.</p>
      <p>Fighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows
the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting
takes three weeks.</p>
      <p>Guarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the tricks
attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes
four weeks.</p>
      <p>Heavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor knows
the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes two
weeks.</p>
      <p>Hunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the
tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal
for hunting takes six weeks.</p>
      <p>Performance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance knows
the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for
performance takes five weeks.</p>
      <p>Riding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows the
tricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for riding takes three
weeks.</p>
      <p><i>Rear a Wild Animal</i>: To rear an animal means to raise a
wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler
can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once. A
successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time
it&#8217;s being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated animal later.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Handling an animal is a move action,
while pushing an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or ranger can
handle her animal companion as a free action or push it as a move
action.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must
spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being
handled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the
Handle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear,
or train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching,
rearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the
remainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training.
If the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to
completion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal
automatically fails.</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes, except for rearing an animal.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: You can use this skill on a creature with an
Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any
such check increases by 5. Such creatures have the same limit on tricks
known as animals do.</p>
      <p>A druid or ranger gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Handle
Animal checks involving her animal companion. In addition, a druid&#8217;s or
ranger&#8217;s animal companion knows one or more bonus tricks, which don&#8217;t
count against the normal limit on tricks known and don&#8217;t require any
training time or Handle Animal checks to teach.</p>
      <p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#animal-affinity"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Animal Affinity</a> feat, you get a
+2 bonus on Handle Animal checks.</p>
      <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal,
you get a +2 bonus on <a href="skillsAll.html#ride"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Ride</a> checks and wild empathy
checks.</p>
      <p><b>Untrained</b>: If you have no ranks in Handle Animal, you
can use a Charisma check to handle and push domestic animals, but you
can&#8217;t teach, rear, or train animals. A druid or ranger with no ranks in
Handle Animal can use a Charisma check to handle and push her animal
companion, but she can&#8217;t teach, rear, or train other nondomestic
animals.</p>
      <h5>INTIMIDATE (CHA)</h5>
      <p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: You can change another&#8217;s
behavior with a successful check. Your Intimidate check is opposed by
the target&#8217;s modified level check (1d20 + character level or Hit Dice +
target&#8217;s Wisdom bonus [if any] + target&#8217;s modifiers on saves against
fear). If you beat your target&#8217;s check result, you may treat the target
as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains
intimidated. (That is, the target retains its normal attitude, but will
chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while
intimidated. See the <a href="skillsAll.html#diplomacy"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Diplomacy</a> skill, above, for
additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in
your presence, and for 1d6&times;10 minutes afterward. After this time,
the target&#8217;s default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly (or, if
normally unfriendly, to hostile).</p>
      <p>If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you
with incorrect or useless information, or otherwise frustrates your
efforts.</p>
      <p><i>Demoralize Opponent</i>: You can also use Intimidate to
weaken an opponent&#8217;s resolve in combat. To do so, make an Intimidate
check opposed by the target&#8217;s modified level check (see above). If you
win, the target becomes <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#shaken"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">shaken</a> for 1 round. A shaken
character takes a &#8211;2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and
saving throws. You can intimidate only an opponent that you threaten in
melee combat and that can see you.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Changing another&#8217;s behavior requires 1
minute of interaction. Intimidating an opponent in combat is a standard
action.</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: Optional, but not recommended because
retries usually do not work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the
other character can be intimidated only so far, and a retry doesn&#8217;t
help. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably
become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and a retry is
futile.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: You gain a +4 bonus on your Intimidate check
for every size category that you are larger than your target.
Conversely, you take a &#8211;4 penalty on your Intimidate check for every
size category that you are smaller than your target.</p>
      <p>A character immune to fear can&#8217;t be intimidated, nor can
nonintelligent creatures.</p>
      <p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#persuasive"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Persuasive</a> feat, you get a +2
bonus on Intimidate checks.</p>
      <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in <a
 href="skillsAll.html#bluff" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Bluff</a>,
you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</p>
      <h5>PERFORM (CHA)</h5>
      <p class="initial">Like Craft, Knowledge, and Profession, Perform
is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Perform
skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.</p>
      <p>Each of the nine categories of the Perform skill includes a
variety of methods, instruments, or techniques, a small list of which
is provided for each category below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Act (comedy, drama, mime)</li>
        <li>Comedy (buffoonery, limericks, joke-telling)</li>
        <li>Dance (ballet, waltz, jig)</li>
        <li>Keyboard instruments (harpsichord, piano, pipe organ)</li>
        <li>Oratory (epic, ode, storytelling)</li>
        <li>Percussion instruments (bells, chimes, drums, gong)</li>
        <li>String instruments (fiddle, harp, lute, mandolin)</li>
        <li>Wind instruments (flute, pan pipes, recorder, shawm,
trumpet)</li>
        <li>Sing (ballad, chant, melody)</li>

      <p>A masterwork musical instrument gives you a +2 circumstance
bonus on Perform checks that involve its use.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in
public requires anywhere from an evening&#8217;s work to a full day&#8217;s
performance. The bard&#8217;s special Perform-based abilities are described
in that class&#8217;s description.</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don&#8217;t
negate previous failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in
the past is likely to be prejudiced against future performances.
(Increase the DC by 2 for each previous failure.)</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A bard must have at least 3 ranks in a Perform
skill to inspire courage in his allies, or to use his countersong or
his fascinate ability. A bard needs 6 ranks in a Perform skill to
inspire competence, 9 ranks to use his suggestion ability, 12 ranks to
inspire greatness, 15 ranks to use his song of freedom ability, 18
ranks to inspire heroics, and 21 ranks to use his mass suggestion
ability. See Bardic Music in the bard class description.</p>
      <p>In addition to using the Perform skill, you can entertain
people with sleight of hand, tumbling, tightrope walking, and spells
(especially illusions).</p>
      <h5>USE MAGIC DEVICE (CHA; TRAINED ONLY)</h5>
      <p class="initial">Use this skill to activate magic</p>
      <p><b>Check</b>: You can use this skill to read a spell or to
activate a magic item. Use Magic Device lets you use a magic item as if
you had the spell ability or class features of another class, as if you
were a different race, or as if you were of a different alignment.</p>
      <p>You make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a
device such as a wand. If you are using the check to emulate an
alignment or some other quality in an ongoing manner, you need to make
the relevant Use Magic Device check once per hour.</p>
      <p>You must consciously choose which requirement to emulate. That
is, you must know what you are trying to emulate when you make a Use
Magic Device check for that purpose. The DCs for various tasks
involving Use Magic Device checks are summarized on the table below.</p>

      <p><i>Activate Blindly</i>: Some magic items are activated by
special words, thoughts, or actions. You can activate such an item as
if you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when
you&#8217;re not and even if you don&#8217;t know it. You do have to perform some
equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must
speak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to
activate. You get a special +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if
you&#8217;ve activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail
by 9 or less, you can&#8217;t activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more,
you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released
but it doesn&#8217;t do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are
that the item affects the wrong target or that uncontrolled magical
energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is
in addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally run when you
cast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast yourself.</p>
      <p><i>Decipher a Written Spell</i>: This usage works just like
deciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the
DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of
concentration.</p>
      <p><i>Emulate an Ability Score</i>: To cast a spell from a
scroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability (Intelligence
for wizard spells, Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for sorcerer
or bard spells). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class
you&#8217;re emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll) is
your Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already have a high
enough score in the appropriate ability, you don&#8217;t need to make this
check.</p>
      <p><i>Emulate an Alignment</i>: Some magic items have positive or
negative effects based on the user&#8217;s alignment. Use Magic Device lets
you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You
can emulate only one alignment at a time.</p>
      <p><i>Emulate a Class Feature</i>: Sometimes you need to use a
class feature to activate a magic item. In this case, your effective
level in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result
minus 20. This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of
another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class
feature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment
requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an
appropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see
above).</p>
      <p><i>Emulate a Race</i>: Some magic items work only for members
of certain races, or work better for members of those races. You can
use such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate
only one race at a time.</p>
      <p><i>Use a Scroll</i>: If you are casting a spell from a scroll,
you have to decipher it first. Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll,
you must have the scroll&#8217;s spell on your class spell list. Use Magic
Device allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on
your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the
spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a
spell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the
appropriate ability. If you don&#8217;t have a sufficient score in that
ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic
Device check (see above).</p>
      <p>This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion
magic items.</p>
      <p><i>Use a Wand</i>: Normally, to use a wand, you must have the
wand&#8217;s spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill allows you
to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell
list. This use of the skill also applies to other spell trigger magic
items, such as staffs.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: None. The Use Magic Device check is made as
part of the action (if any) required to activate the magic item.</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while
attempting to activate an item and you fail, then you can&#8217;t try to
activate that item again for 24 hours.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: You cannot take 10 with this skill.</p>
      <p>You can&#8217;t aid another on Use Magic Device checks. Only the
user of the item may attempt such a check.</p>
      <p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#magical-aptitude"
