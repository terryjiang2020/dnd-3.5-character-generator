      <p>You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them.
Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle,
sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a
single short, violent thrust.</p>
      <p><i>Sustained Force</i>: A sustained force moves an object
weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at
15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect
on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell
resistance.</p>
      <p>This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level,
but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved
vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be
moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond
the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls
or stops.</p>
      <p>An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one
hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned,
an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the
weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though
delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks.</p>
      <p><i>Combat Maneuver</i>: Alternatively, once per round, you can
use telekinesis to perform a <a href="specialAttacks.html#bull-rush"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">bull rush</a>, <a
 href="specialAttacks.html#disarm" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">disarm</a>,
      <a href="specialAttacks.html#grapple"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">grapple</a> (including
pin), or <a href="specialAttacks.html#trip"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">trip</a>. Resolve these attempts as
normal, except that they don&rsquo;t
provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of
your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your
Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a
sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed
attempt doesn&rsquo;t allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as
for
disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell
resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round
per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.</p>
      <p><i>Violent Thrust</i>: Alternatively, the spell energy can be
spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster
level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each
other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects.
You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level
(maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).</p>
      <p>You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object
thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus
+ your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a
sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note
that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in
this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25
pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25
pounds (for hard, dense objects).</p>
      <p>Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can
be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to
negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by
the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface,
it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).</p>

      <p>This spell functions like <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#resilient-sphere">resilient sphere</a>,with the addition
that the creatures or objects inside the globe are nearly weightless.
Anything contained within an telekinetic sphere weighs only
one-sixteenth of its normal weight. You can telekinetically lift
anything in the sphere that normally weighs 5,000 pounds or less. The
telekinetic control extends from you out to medium range (100 feet + 10
feet per caster level) after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating
its contents.</p>
      <p>You can move objects or creatures in the sphere that weigh a
total of 5,000 pounds or less by concentrating on the sphere. You can
begin moving a sphere in the round after casting the spell. If you
concentrate on doing so (a standard action), you can move the sphere as
much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease concentrating, the sphere does
not move in that round (if on a level surface) or descends at its
falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface, or the
spell&rsquo;s duration expires, or you begin concentrating again. If
you
cease concentrating (voluntarily or due to failing a <a
 href="skillsAll.html#concentration" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Concentration</a>
check), you can resume concentrating on your next turn or any later
turn during the spell&rsquo;s duration.</p>
      <p>The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is
not fast enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere.</p>
      <p>You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.</p>

      <p>You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of
willing creatures, each of which must have an Intelligence score of 3
or higher. Each creature included in the link is linked to all the
others. The creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond
regardless of language. No special power or influence is established as
a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any
distance (although not from one plane to another).</p>
      <p>If desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond
forged. This decision must be made at the time of casting.</p>

      <p>This spell instantly transports you to a designated
destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level.
Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long
as their weight doesn&rsquo;t exceed your maximum load. You may also
bring
one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or
objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three
caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge
creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to
be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of
those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where
the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving
throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or
in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell
resistance.</p>
      <p>You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of
the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the
teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may
make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.</p>
      <p>To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult
the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions
of the terms on the table.</p>
      <p><i>Familiarity</i>: &ldquo;Very familiar&rdquo; is a place
where you have
been very often and where you feel at home. &ldquo;Studied
carefully&rdquo; is a
place you know well, either because you can currently see it,
you&rsquo;ve
been there often, or you have used other means (such as scrying) to
study the place for at least one hour. &ldquo;Seen casually&rdquo; is a
place that
you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar.
&ldquo;Viewed once&rdquo; is a place that you have seen once, possibly
using magic. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;False destination&rdquo; is a place that does not truly
exist or if
you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer
exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be
familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to
obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no
real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target
from.</p>
      <p><i>On Target</i>: You appear where you want to be.</p>
      <p><i>Off Target</i>: You appear safely a random distance away
from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is
1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off
target is determined randomly</p>
      <p><i>Similar Area</i>: You wind up in an area that&rsquo;s
visually or
thematically similar to the target area.</p>
      <p>Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within
range. If no such area exists within the spell&rsquo;s range, the spell
simply fails instead.</p>
      <p><i>Mishap</i>: You and anyone else teleporting with you have
gotten &ldquo;scrambled.&rdquo; You each take 1d10 points of damage,
and you reroll
on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80.
Each time &ldquo;Mishap&rdquo; comes up, the characters take more
damage and must
reroll.</p>

to
teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are
not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane.</p>
      <p>The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice.
If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you
need to mark the circle in some way.</p>
      <p>Teleportation circle can be made permanent with a permanency

      <p>This spell turns natural, uncut or unworked rock of any sort
into an equal volume of mud. Magical stone is not affected by the
spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature
unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks
until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a
&ndash;2
penalty on attack rolls and AC. Brush thrown atop the mud can support
creatures able to climb on top of it. Creatures large enough to walk on
the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet.</p>
      <p>If transmute rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern
or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a
depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6
points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the
area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.</p>
      <p>Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the
effect of the spell, since transmute rock to mud can&rsquo;t affect
worked
stone and doesn&rsquo;t reach deep enough to undermine such
buildings&rsquo;
foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon
foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by
this spell.</p>
      <p>The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute
mud to rock spell restores its substance&mdash;but not necessarily its
form.
Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The
exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.</p>

      <p>Trap the soul forces a creature&rsquo;s life force (and its
material
body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or
until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows
the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful
creature from another plane it can be required to perform a service
immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once
the gem imprisoning it is broken.</p>
      <p>Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered
in one of two ways.</p>
      <p><i>Spell Completion</i>: First, the spell can be completed by
speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a
regular spell at the subject. This allows spell resistance (if any) and
a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature&rsquo;s name is spoken
as
well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2.
If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.</p>
      <p><i>Trigger Object</i>: The second method is far more
insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object
inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the
creature&rsquo;s soul in the trap. To use this method, both the
creature&rsquo;s
name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when
the gem is enspelled. A sympathy spell can also be placed on the
trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger
object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without
the benefit of spell resistance or a save.</p>
      <p><i>Material Component</i>: Before the actual casting of trap
the soul, you must procure a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every
Hit Die possessed by the creature to be trapped. If the gem is not
valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (While
creatures have no concept of level or Hit Dice as such, the value of
the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that
this value can change over time as creatures gain more Hit Dice.)</p>
      <p><i>Focus (Trigger Object Only)</i>: If the trigger object
method is used, a special trigger object, prepared as described above,
is needed.</p>

      <p>By means of this spell, you are able to assume the form of a
Large living tree or shrub or a Large dead tree trunk with a small
number of limbs. The closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in
question is actually a magically concealed creature. To all normal
tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a detect magic spell
reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form, you can
observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your
normal form, and your hit points and save bonuses remain unaffected.
You gain a +10 natural armor bonus to AC but have an effective
Dexterity score of 0 and a speed of 0 feet. You are immune to critical
hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear carried or worn changes
with you.</p>

standard action).</p>

at least equal to yours. By moving into an oak tree (for example), you
instantly know the location of all other oak trees within transport
range (see below) and may choose whether you want to pass into one or
simply step back out of the tree you moved into. You may choose to pass
to any tree of the appropriate kind within the transport range as shown
on the following table.</p>

      <p>You may move into a tree up to one time per caster level
(passing from one tree to another counts only as moving into one tree).
The spell lasts until the duration expires or you exit a tree. Each
transport is a full-round action.</p>
      <p>You can, at your option, remain within a tree without
transporting yourself, but you are forced out when the spell ends. If

unholy site. This has three major effects.</p>
      <p>First, the site or structure is guarded by a magic circle
against good effect.</p>
      <p>Second, all turning checks made to <a

penalty, and turning checks to rebuke undead gain a +4 profane bonus.
Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. (This provision does
not apply to the druid version of the spell.)</p>
      <p>Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the
unhallowed site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions
throughout the entire site, regardless of its normal duration and area
or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all
creatures, creatures that share your faith or alignment, or creatures
that adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the
chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by
casting unhallow again.</p>
      <p>Spell effects that may be tied to an unhallowed site include
aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper
darkness, detect magic, detect good, dimensional anchor, discern lies,
dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge,
protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues,

      <p>A malevolent darkness surrounds the subjects, protecting them
from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by good
creatures, and weakening good creatures when they strike the subjects.
This abjuration has four effects.</p>
      <p>First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC
and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike the effect of protection
from good, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against
attacks by good creatures.</p>
      <p>Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against
good spells and spells cast by good creatures.</p>
      <p>Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence,
just as protection from good does.</p>
      <p>Finally, if a good creature succeeds on a melee attack against
a warded creature, the offending attacker takes 1d6 points of temporary
Strength damage (Fortitude negates).</p>

that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch
things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend.
The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the
same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you
remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and
the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20
pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can
exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain
pressure plates and other devices. It can&rsquo;t perform any task that
requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a
check using a skill that can&rsquo;t be used untrained. Its speed is 15
feet.</p>
      <p>The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an
attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6
points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.)
If you attempt to send it beyond the spell&rsquo;s range (measured from
your
current position), the servant ceases to exist.</p>

feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20
feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on your turn each
round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6

+20) to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage
to undead creatures.</p>
      <p>If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are,
each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any

disintegrate immediately destroys it, as does a rod of cancellation, a
sphere of annihilation, or a mage&rsquo;s disjunction spell. Breath
weapons
and spells cannot pass through the wall in either direction, although
dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier.
It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material ones (though ethereal
creatures can usually get around the wall by floating under or over it
through material floors and ceilings). Gaze attacks can operate through
a wall of force.</p>
      <p>The caster can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose

      <p>This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of
ice, depending on the version selected. A wall of ice cannot form in an
area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be
smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall
when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it
is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell
automatically fails. Fire can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full
damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by
objects). Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of
steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.</p>
      <p><i>Ice Plane</i>: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The
wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square
area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice
100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high,
or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed
1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as
it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor,
while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite
sides.</p>
      <p>Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of
thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall
whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break
through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is
15 + caster level.</p>
      <p>Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid
air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who
broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per
caster level (no save).</p>
      <p><i>Hemisphere</i>: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere
whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The
hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it
does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.</p>

      <p>You cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The
wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area
is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies
the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a
flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.</p>
      <p>A wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can
double the wall&rsquo;s area by halving its thickness. Each 5- foot
square of
the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A
section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature
tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the
Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.</p>
      <p>If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a
flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped
over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely
to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the
wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature
must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with
room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex
saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of
damage. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.</p>
      <p>Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation,
and other natural phenomena.</p>

      <p>This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining
rock surfaces. A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels
and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the
wall&rsquo;s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured
so
that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.</p>
      <p>Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in
almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor
rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be
solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm,
for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20
feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces
the spell&rsquo;s area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow
crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.</p>
      <p>Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a
disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.
Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness
and hardness 8. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is
breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single
attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.</p>
      <p>It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within
or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold
the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex
saves.</p>

      <p>A wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of very tough,
pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a
human&rsquo;s
finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a wall
of thorns takes slashing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus
the creature&rsquo;s AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count
for
this calculation. (Creatures with an Armor Class of 25 or higher,
without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from
contact with the wall.)</p>
      <p>You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows
you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to
twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the
thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much
less time to force its way through the barrier.</p>
      <p>Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by
making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by
which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum
distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or
attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above.
A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in
order to avoid taking any more damage.</p>
      <p>Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast
takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In
order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait
until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through
overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal
speed without taking damage.</p>
      <p>A wall of thorns can be breached by slow work with edged
weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep
for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but
magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>Despite its appearance, a wall of thorns is not actually a
living plant, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants.</p>

      <p>Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands.
These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to
spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored
to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web
collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web
become <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#entangled"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">entangled</a> among the gluey
fibers. Attacking a creature in a web
won&rsquo;t cause you to become entangled.</p>
      <p>Anyone in the effect&rsquo;s area when the spell is cast must
make a
Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not
prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for
being entangled (see below). If the save fails, the creature is
entangled and can&rsquo;t move from its space, but can break loose by
spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 <a
 href="skillsAll.html#escape-artist" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Escape
Artist</a> check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save
or a
later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains
entangled, but may move through the web very slowly. Each round devoted
to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape
Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which
the check result exceeds 10.</p>
      <p>If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an
opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web
between you, it provides total cover.</p>
      <p>The strands of a web spell are flammable. A magic flaming
sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any
fire can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round.
All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from
the flames.</p>

succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held
suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round
on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject
any carried creatures whenever you wish, depositing the hapless souls
wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released.</p>

      <p>You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot.
The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range that is
familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A
whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches
the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other
sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone
is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.</p>
      <p>You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than
twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round,
or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the
air. You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as 1
mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in
place until the message is delivered. As with magic mouth, whispering
wind cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate
magical effects.</p>

      <p>You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as
the gaseous form spell) and move through the air, possibly at great
speed. You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts
independently.</p>
      <p>Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with
perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind
wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with
poor maneuverability. Wind walkers are not <a
 href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#invisible"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">invisible</a> but rather appear
misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely
to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.</p>
      <p>A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and
later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form
takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does
any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the
spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not
others.</p>
      <p>For the last minute of the spell&rsquo;s duration, a wind
walker in
cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600
feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves
as a warning that the spell is about to end.</p>

maintain its grasp on an object.) Tiny and Small flying creatures

      <p>Wish is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By
simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you.</p>
      <p>Even wish, however, has its limits.</p>
      <p>A wish can produce any one of the following effects.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or
lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided
the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or
lower even if it&rsquo;s of a prohibited school.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if
it&rsquo;s of a prohibited school. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as
geas/quest or insanity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing
magic item.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score.
Two to five wish spells cast in immediate succession can grant a
creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for
a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on).
Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note:
An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and
inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only
the best one applies.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid one
creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind
of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your
companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in
the party, but not do both with the same wish. A wish can never restore
the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or
Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Revive the dead. A wish can bring a <a
 href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#dead"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">dead</a> creature back to
life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can revive a dead
creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wishes,
one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life
again. A wish cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life
from losing an experience level.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per
caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures
anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling
target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if
any) applies.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event.
The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round
(including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the
new result. For example, a wish could undo an opponent&rsquo;s
successful
save, a foe&rsquo;s successful critical hit (either the attack roll or
the
critical roll), a friend&rsquo;s failed save, and so on. The reroll,
however,
may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target
gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any)
applies.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than
these, but doing so is dangerous. (The wish may pervert your intent
into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial
fulfillment.)</p>
      <p>Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal
(but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).</p>
      <p><i>Material Component</i>: When a wish duplicates a spell with
a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide
that component.</p>
      <p><i>XP Cost</i>: The minimum XP cost for casting wish is 5,000
XP. When a wish duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay
5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a wish creates or
improves a magic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for
crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this
spell, nonchaotic extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly
banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return
for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether
the creatures hear the word of chaos. The banishment effect allows a
Will save (at a &ndash;4 penalty) to negate.</p>
      <p>Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by
word of chaos.</p>

      <p>Word of recall teleports you instantly back to your sanctuary
when the word is uttered. You must designate the sanctuary when you
prepare the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual
point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10
feet. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot
travel between planes. You can transport, in addition to yourself, any
objects you carry, as long as their weight doesn&rsquo;t exceed your
maximum
load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller
creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its
equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two
Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so
forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one
another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with
you. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail.</p>
      <p>An unwilling creature can&rsquo;t be teleported by word of
recall.
Likewise, a creature&rsquo;s Will save (or spell resistance) prevents
items
in its possession from being teleported. Unattended, nonmagical objects
receive no saving throw.</p>

affected creature is allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell
is cast or when the creature first enters the emanation area. Affected
creatures are aware of this enchantment. Therefore, they may avoid
answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or
they may be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the
