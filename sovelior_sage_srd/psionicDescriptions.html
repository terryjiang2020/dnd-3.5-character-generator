The description of each power is presented in a standard format. Each
category of information is explained and defined below.<br />
      <a id="power-name"></a><h5>NAME</h5>
The first line of every power description gives the name by which the
power is generally known. A power might be known by other names in some
locales, and specific manifesters might have names of their own for
their powers.<br />
      <a id="discipline-subdiscipline"></a><h5>DISCIPLINE (SUBDISCIPLINE)</h5>
Beneath the power name is a line giving the discipline (and the
subdiscipline in parentheses, if appropriate) that the power belongs to.<br />
Every power is associated with one of six disciplines. A discipline is
a group of related powers that work in similar ways. Each of the
disciplines is discussed below.<br />
      <a id="clairsentience"></a><h6>Clairsentience</h6>
Clairsentience powers enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, to
glimpse the immediate future and predict the far future, to find hidden
objects, and to know what is normally unknowable.<br />
      <p>For the purpose of psionics-magic transparency, clairsentience
powers are equivalent to powers of the divination school (thus,
creatures immune to divination spells are also immune to clairsentience
powers).</p>
      <p>Many clairsentience powers have cone-shaped areas. These move
with you and extend in the direction you look. The cone defines the
area that you can sweep each round. If you study the same area for
multiple rounds, you can often gain additional information, as noted in
the descriptive text for the power.</p>
      <a id="scrying"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scrying:</span> A power of
the scrying subdiscipline creates an invisible sensor that sends you
information. Unless noted otherwise, the sensor has the same powers of
sensory acuity that you possess. This includes any powers or effects
that target you, but not powers or effects that emanate from you.
However, the sensor is treated as a separate, independent sensory organ
of yours, and thus functions normally even if you have been <a
 href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#blinded"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">blinded</a>, <a
 href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#deafened"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">deafened</a>, or otherwise suffered
sensory impairment. Any creature with an Intelligence score of 12 or
higher can notice the sensor by making a DC 20 Intelligence check. The
sensor can be <a href="psionicPowersDtoF.html#dispel-psionics"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">dispelled</a> as if it were an
active power. Lead sheeting or psionic protection blocks scrying
powers, and you sense that the power is so blocked.</p>
      <a id="metacreativity"></a><h6>Metacreativity</h6>
Metacreativity powers create objects, creatures, or some form of
matter. Creatures you create usually, but not always, obey your
commands.<br />
A metacreativity power draws raw ectoplasm from the Astral Plane to
create an object or creature in the place the psionic character
designates (subject to the limits noted above). Objects created in this
fashion are as solid and durable as normal objects, despite their
originally diaphanous substance. Psionic creatures created with
metacreativity powers are considered constructs, not outsiders.<br />
      <p>A creature or object brought into being cannot appear inside
another creature or object, nor can it appear floating in an empty
space. It must arrive in an open location on a surface capable of
supporting it. The creature or object must appear within the
power&rsquo;s
range, but it does not have to remain within the range.</p>
      <p>For the purpose of psionics-magic transparency, metacreativity
powers are equivalent to powers of the conjuration school (thus,
creatures immune to conjuration spells are also immune to
metacreativity powers).</p>
      <a id="creation"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creation:</span> A power of
the creation subdiscipline creates an object or creature in the place
the manifester designates (subject to the limits noted above). If the
power has a duration other than instantaneous, psionic energy holds the
creation together, and when the power ends, the created creature or
object vanishes without a trace, except for a thin film of glistening
ectoplasm that quickly evaporates. If the power has an instantaneous
duration, the created object or creature is merely assembled through
psionics. It lasts indefinitely and does not depend on psionics for its
existence.</p>
      <a id="psychokinesis"></a><h6>Psychokinesis</h6>
Psychokinesis powers manipulate energy or tap the power of the mind to
produce a desired end. Many of these powers produce spectacular effects
above and beyond the power&rsquo;s standard display (see <a
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="#display">Display</a>,
below), such as moving, melting, transforming, or blasting a target.
Psychokinesis powers can deal large amounts of damage.<br />
      <p>For the purpose of psionics-magic transparency, psychokinesis
powers are equivalent to powers of the evocation school (thus,
creatures immune to evocation spells are also immune to psychokinesis
powers).</p>
      <a id="psychometabolism"></a><h6>Psychometabolism</h6>
Psychometabolism powers change the physical properties of some
creature, thing, or condition. <br />
      <p>For the purpose of psionics- magic transparency,
psychometabolism powers are equivalent to powers of the transmutation
school (thus, creatures immune to transmutation spells are also immune
to psychometabolism powers).</p>
      <a id="healing"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Healing:</span>
Psychometabolism powers of the healing subdiscipline can remove damage
from creatures. However, psionic healing usually falls short of divine
magical healing, in direct comparisons. </p>
      <a id="psychoportation"></a><h6>Psychoportation</h6>
Psychoportation powers move the manifester, an object, or another
creature through space and time.<br />
      <p>For the purpose of psionics-magic transparency,
psychoportation powers do not have an equivalent school.</p>
      <a id="teleportation"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Teleportation:</span> A power
of the teleportation subdiscipline transports one or more creatures or
objects a great distance. The most potent of these powers can cross
planar boundaries. Usually the transportation is one-way (unless
otherwise noted) and not dispellable. Teleportation is instantaneous
travel through the Astral Plane. Anything that blocks astral travel
also blocks teleportation.</p>
      <a id="telepathy"></a><h6>Telepathy</h6>
Telepathy powers can spy on and affect the minds of others, influencing
or controlling their behavior.<br />
      <p>Most telepathy powers are mind-affecting.</p>
      <p>For the purpose of psionics-magic transparency, telepathy
powers are equivalent to powers of the enchantment school (thus,
creatures resistant to enchantment spells are equally resistant to
telepathy powers).</p>
      <a id="charm"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Charm:</span> A power of the
charm subdiscipline changes the way the subject views you, typically
making it see you as a good friend.</p>
      <a id="compulsion"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Compulsion:</span> A power of
the compulsion subdiscipline forces the subject to act in some manner
or changes the way her mind works. Some compulsion powers determine the
subject&rsquo;s actions or the effects on the subject, some allow you
to
determine the subject&rsquo;s actions when you manifest them, and
others give
you ongoing control over the subject.</p>
      <a id="descriptor"></a><h5>[DESCRIPTOR]</h5>
Appearing on the same line as the discipline and subdiscipline (when
applicable) is a descriptor that further categorizes the power in some
way. Some powers have more than one descriptor.<br />
      <p>The descriptors that apply to powers are acid, cold, death,
electricity, evil, fire, force, good, language-dependent, light,
mind-affecting, and sonic.</p>
      <p>Most of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves,
but they govern how the power interacts with other powers, with spells,
with special abilities, with unusual creatures, with alignment, and so
on.</p>
      <p>A language-dependent power uses intelligible language as a
medium. </p>
      <p>A mind-affecting power works only against creatures with an
Intelligence score of 1 or higher.</p>
      <a id="level"></a><h5>LEVEL</h5>
The next line of the power description gives a power&rsquo;s level, a
number
between 1 and 9 that defines the power&rsquo;s relative strength. This
number
is preceded by the name of the class whose members can manifest the
power. If a power is part of a discipline&rsquo;s list instead of the
psion&rsquo;s
general power list, this will be indicated by the name of the
discipline&rsquo;s specialist. The specialists a power can be
associated with
include Egoist (psychometabolism), Kineticist (psychokinesis), Nomad
(psychoportation), Seer (clairsentience), Shaper (metacreativity), and
Telepath (telepathy). <br />
      <h5><a id="display"></a>DISPLAY</h5>
When a power is manifested, a display may accompany the primary effect.
This secondary effect may be auditory, material, mental, olfactory, or
visual. No power&rsquo;s display is significant enough to create
consequences
for the psionic creatures, allies, or opponents during combat. The
secondary effect for a power occurs only if the power&rsquo;s
description
indicates it. If multiple powers with similar displays are in effect
simultaneously, the displays do not necessary become more intense.
Instead, the overall display remains much the same, though with minute
spikes in intensity. A <a href="psionicSkills.html#psicraft"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Psicraft</a> check (DC 10 + 1 per
additional power in use) reveals the exact number of simultaneous
powers in play.<br />
      <a id="dispense-with-displays"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dispense with Displays:</span>
Despite the fact that almost every power has a display, a psionic
character can always choose to manifest the power without the flashy
accompaniment. To manifest a power without any display (no matter how
many displays it might have), a manifester must make a <a
 href="psionicSkills.html#concentration"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Concentration</a> check (DC 15 + the
level of the power). This check is part of the action of manifesting
the power. If the check is unsuccessful, the power manifests normally
with its display.</p>
      <p>Even if a manifester manifests a power without a display, he
is still subject to attacks of opportunity in appropriate
circumstances. (Of course, another Concentration check can be made as
normal to either manifest defensively or maintain the power if
attacked.)</p>
      <a id="auditory"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Auditory:</span> A
bass-pitched hum issues from the manifester&rsquo;s vicinity or in the
vicinity of the power&rsquo;s subject (manifester&rsquo;s choice),
eerily akin to
many deep-pitched voices. The sound grows in a second from hardly
noticeable to as loud as a shout strident enough to be heard within 100
feet. At the manifester&rsquo;s option, the instantaneous sound can be
so
soft that it can be heard only within 15 feet with a successful DC 10 <a
 href="skillsAll.html#listen" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Listen</a>
check. Some powers describe unique auditory displays.</p>
      <a id="material"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Material:</span> The subject
or the area is briefly slicked with a translucent, shimmering
substance. The glistening substance evaporates after 1 round regardless
of the power&rsquo;s duration. Sophisticated psions recognize the
material as
ectoplasmic seepage from the Astral Plane; this substance is completely
inert.</p>
      <a id="mental"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mental:</span> A subtle chime
rings once in the minds of creatures within 15 feet of either the
manifester or the subject (at the manifester&rsquo;s option). At the
manifester&rsquo;s option, the chime can ring continuously for the
power&rsquo;s
duration. Some powers describe unique mental displays. </p>
      <a id="olfactory"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Olfactory:</span> An odd but
familiar odor brings to mind a brief mental flash of a long-buried
memory. The scent is difficult to pin down, and no two individuals ever
describe it the same way. The odor originates from the manifester and
spreads to a distance of 20 feet, then fades in less than a second (or
lasts for the duration, at the manifester&rsquo;s option).</p>
      <a id="visual"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Visual:</span> The
manifester&rsquo;s eyes burn like points of silver fire while the power
remains in effect. A rainbow-flash of light sweeps away from the
manifester to a distance of 5 feet and then dissipates, unless a unique
visual display is described. This is the case when the Display entry
includes &ldquo;see text,&rdquo; which means that a visual effect is
described
somewhere in the text of the power. </p>
      <a id="manifesting-time"></a><h5>MANIFESTING TIME</h5>
Most powers have a manifesing time of 1 standard action. Others take 1
round or more, while a few require only a free action.<br />
      <p>A power that takes 1 round to manifest requires a full-round
action. It comes into effect just before the beginning of your turn in
the round after you began manifesting the power. You then act normally
after the power is completed. </p>
      <p>A power that takes 1 minute to manifest comes into effect just
before your turn 1 minute later (and for each of those 10 rounds, you
are manifesting a power as a full-round action, as noted above for
1-round manifesting times). These actions must be consecutive and
uninterrupted, or the power points are lost and the power fails.</p>
      <p>When you use a power that takes 1 round or longer to manifest,
you must continue the concentration from the current round to just
before your turn in the next round (at least). If you lose
concentration before the manifesting time is complete, the power points
are lost and the power fails.</p>
      <p>You make all pertinent decisions about a power (range, target,
area, effect, version, and so forth) when the power comes into effect. </p>
      <a id="new-action-types"></a><h6>New Action Types</h6>
      <a id="swift-action"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Swift Action:</span> A swift
action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger
expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. You can perform
one swift action per turn without affecting your ability to perform
other actions. In that regard, a swift action is like a free action.
However, you can perform only a single swift action per turn,
regardless of what other actions you take. You can take a swift action
any time you would normally be allowed to take a free action. Swift
actions usually involve psionics or the activation of psionic items;
many characters (especially those who don&rsquo;t use psionics) never
have an
opportunity to take a swift action.<br />
Manifesting a quickened power is a swift action. In addition,
manifesting any power with a casting time of 1 swift action is a swift
action.<br />
Manifesting a power with a manifesting time of 1 swift action does not
provoke attacks of opportunity. <br />
      <a id="immediate-action"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Immediate Action:</span> Much
like a swift action, an immediate action consumes a very small amount
of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than
a free action. However, unlike a swift action, an immediate action can
be performed at any time - even if it&rsquo;s not your turn. Using an
immediate action on your turn is the same as using a swift action, and
counts as your swift action for that turn. You cannot use another
immediate action or a swift action until after your next turn if you
have used an immediate action when it is not currently your turn
(effectively, using an immediate action before your turn is equivalent
to using your swift action for the coming turn). You also cannot use an
immediate action if you are currently flat-footed.</p>
      <a id="range"></a><h5>RANGE</h5>
A power&rsquo;s range indicates how far from you it can reach, as
defined in
the Range entry of the power description. A power&rsquo;s range is the
maximum distance from you that the power&rsquo;s effect can occur, as
well as
the maximum distance at which you can designate the power&rsquo;s point
of
origin. If any portion of the area would extend beyond the range, that
area is wasted. Standard ranges include the following.<br />
      <a id="range-personal"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Personal:</span> The power
affects only you.</p>
      <a id="range-touch"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Touch:</span> You must touch
a creature or object to affect it. A touch power that deals damage can
score a critical hit just as a weapon can. A touch power threatens a
critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a
successful critical hit. Some touch powers allow you to touch multiple
targets. You can touch as many willing targets as you can reach, but
all targets of the spell must be touched in the same round that you
manifest the power.</p>
      <a id="range-close"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Close:</span> The power
reaches as far as 25 feet away from you. The maximum range increases 5
feet for every two manifester levels you have.</p>
      <a id="range-medium"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Medium:</span> The power
reaches as far as 100 feet + 10 feet per manifester level.</p>
      <a id="range-long"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Long:</span> The power
reaches as far as 400 feet + 40 feet per manifester level.</p>
      <a id="range-expressed-in-feet"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Range Expressed in Feet:</span>
Some powers have no standard range category, just a range expressed in
feet.</p>
      <a id="aiming-a-power"></a><h5>AIMING A POWER</h5>
You must make some choice about whom the power is to affect or where
the power&rsquo;s effect is to originate, depending on the type of
power. The
next entry in a power description defines the power&rsquo;s target (or
targets), its effect, or its area, as appropriate.<br />
      <a id="target-or-targets"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Target or Targets:</span>
Some powers have a target or targets. You manifest these powers on
creatures or objects, as defined by the power itself. You must be able
to see or touch the target, and you must specifically choose that
target. However, you do not have to select your target until you finish
manifesting the power.</p>
      <p>If you manifest a targeted power on the wrong type of target
the power has no effect. If the target of a power is yourself (the
power description has a line that reads &ldquo;Target: You&rdquo;), you
do not
receive a saving throw and power resistance does not apply. The Saving
Throw and Power Resistance lines are omitted from such powers.</p>
      <p>Some powers can be manifested only on willing targets.
Declaring yourself as a willing target is something that can be done at
any time (even if you&rsquo;re flat-footed or it isn&rsquo;t your
turn). <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Unconscious</a> creatures are
automatically considered willing, but a character who is conscious but
immobile or <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#helpless"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">helpless</a> (such as one who is
bound, <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#cowering"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">cowering</a>, <a
 href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#grappling"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">grappling</a>, <a
 href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#paralyzed"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">paralyzed</a>, <a
 href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#pinned"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">pinned</a>, or <a
 href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#stunned"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">stunned</a>) is not automatically
willing. The Saving Throw and Power Resistance lines are usually
omitted from such powers, since only willing subjects can be targeted.</p>
      <a id="effect"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Effect:</span> Some powers,
such as most metacreativity powers, create things rather than affect
things that are already present. Unless otherwise noted in the power
description, you must designate the location where these things are to
appear, either by seeing it or defining it. Range determines how far
away an effect can appear, but if the effect is mobile, it can move
regardless of the power&rsquo;s range once created.</p>
      <a id="ray"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ray:</span> Some effects are
rays. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically you
make a ranged touch attack rather than a normal ranged attack. As with
a ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an <a
 href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#invisible"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">invisible</a> creature and hope you
hit something. You don&rsquo;t have to see the creature you&rsquo;re
trying to hit,
as you do with a targeted power. Intervening creatures and obstacles,
however, can block your line of sight or provide cover for the creature
you&rsquo;re aiming at.</p>
      <p>If a ray power has a duration, it&rsquo;s the duration of the
effect
that the ray causes, not the length of time the ray itself persists.</p>
      <p>If a ray power deals damage, you can score a critical hit just
as if it were a weapon. A ray power threatens a critical hit on a
natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit.</p>
      <a id="spread"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spread:</span> Some effects
spread out from a point of origin (which may be a grid intersection, or
may be the manifester) to a distance described in the power. The effect
can extend around corners and into areas that you can&rsquo;t see.
Figure
distance by actual distance traveled, taking into account turns the
effect may take. When determining distance for spread effects, count
around walls, not through them. As with movement, do not trace
diagonals across corners. You must designate the point of origin for
such an effect (unless the effect is centered on you), but you need not
have line of effect (see below) to all portions of the effect.</p>
      <a id="shapeable"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(S) Shapeable:</span> If an
Effect line ends with &ldquo;(S)&rdquo; you can shape the power. A
shaped effect
can have no dimension smaller than 10 feet.</p>
      <a id="area"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Area:</span> Some powers
affect an area. Sometimes a power description specifies a specially
defined area, but usually an area falls into one of the categories
defined below.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the shape of the area, you select the point
where the power originates, but otherwise you usually don&rsquo;t
control
which creatures or objects the power affects. The point of origin of a
power that affects an area is always a grid intersection. When
determining whether a given creature is within the area of a power,
count out the distance from the point of origin in squares just as you
do when moving a character or when determining the range for a ranged
attack. The only difference is that instead of counting from the center
of one square to the center of the next, you count from intersection to
intersection.</p>
      <p>You can count diagonally across a square, but every second
diagonal counts as 2 squares of distance. If the far edge of a square
is within the power&rsquo;s area, anything within that square is within
the
power&rsquo;s area. If the power&rsquo;s area touches only the near
edge of a
square, however, anything within that square is unaffected by the power.</p>
      <a id="burst-emanation-or-spread"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Burst, Emanation, or Spread:</span>
Most powers that affect an area function as a burst, an emanation, or a
spread. In each case, you select the power&rsquo;s point of origin and
measure its effect from that point. A burst power affects whatever it
catches in its area, even including creatures that you can&rsquo;t see.
It
can&rsquo;t affect creatures with total cover from its point of origin
(in
other words, its effects don&rsquo;t extend around corners). The
default
shape for a burst effect is a sphere, but some burst powers are
specifically described as cone-shaped.</p>
      <p>A burst&rsquo;s area defines how far from the point of origin
the
power&rsquo;s effect extends.</p>
      <p>An emanation power functions like a burst power, except that
the effect continues to radiate from the point of origin for the
duration of the power.</p>
      <p>A spread power spreads out like a burst but can turn corners.
You select the point of origin, and the power spreads out a given
distance in all directions. Figure the area the power effect fills by
taking into account any turns the effect takes.</p>
      <a id="cone-line-or-sphere"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Cone, Line, or Sphere:</span>
Most powers that affect an area have a particular shape, such as a
cone, line, or sphere. A cone-shaped power shoots away from you in a
quarter-circle in the direction you designate. It starts from any
corner of your square and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either
bursts or emanations (see above), and thus won&rsquo;t go around
corners.</p>
      <p>A line-shaped power shoots away from you in a line in the
direction you designate. It starts from any corner of your square and
extends to the limit of its range or until it strikes a barrier that
blocks line of effect. A line-shaped power affects all creatures in
squares that the line passes through or touches.</p>
      <p>A sphere-shaped power expands from its point of origin to fill
a spherical area. Spheres may be bursts, emanations, or spreads.</p>
      <a id="area-other"></a><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Other:</span> A power can
have a unique area, as defined in its description.</p>
      <a id="line-of-effect"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Line of Effect:</span> A line
of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what a power can
affect. A solid barrier cancels a line of effect, but it is not blocked
by fog, darkness, and other factors that limit normal sight. You must
have a clear line of effect to any target that you manifest a power on
or to any space in which you wish to create an effect. You must have a
clear line of effect to the point of origin of any power you manifest.</p>
      <p>A burst, cone, or emanation power affects only an area,
creatures, or objects to which it has line of effect from its origin (a
spherical burst&rsquo;s center point, a cone-shaped burst&rsquo;s
starting point,
or an emanation&rsquo;s point of origin). An otherwise solid barrier
with a
hole of at least 1 square foot through it does not block a
power&rsquo;s line
of effect. Such an opening means that the 5-foot length of wall
containing the hole is no longer considered a barrier for the purpose
of determining a power&rsquo;s line of effect.</p>
      <a id="duration"></a><h5>DURATION</h5>
A power&rsquo;s Duration line tells you how long the psionic energy of
the
power lasts.<br />
      <a id="timed-durations"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Timed Durations:</span> Many
durations are measured in rounds, minutes, hours,
or some other increment. When the time is up, the psionic energy
sustaining the effect fades, and the power ends. If a power&rsquo;s
duration
is variable it is rolled secretly.</p>
      <a id="duration-instantaneous"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Instantaneous:</span> The
psionic energy comes and goes the instant the power
is manifested, though the consequences might be long-lasting.</p>
      <a id="duration-permanent"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Permanent:</span> The energy
remains as long as the effect does. This means
the power is vulnerable to <a
 href="psionicPowersDtoF.html#dispel-psionics"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">dispel psionics</a>.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Concentration:</span> The
power lasts as long as you concentrate on it.
Concentrating to maintain a power is a standard action that does not
provoke attacks of opportunity. Anything that could break your
concentration when manifesting a power can also break your
concentration while you&rsquo;re maintaining one, causing the power to
end.
You can&rsquo;t manifest a power while concentrating on another one.
Some
powers may last for a short time after you cease concentrating. In such
a case, the power keeps going for the given length of time after you
stop concentrating, but no longer. Otherwise, you must concentrate to
maintain the power, but you can&rsquo;t maintain it for more than a
stated
duration in any event. If a target moves out of range, the power reacts
as if your concentration had been broken.</p>
      <a id="subjects-effects-and-areas"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subjects, Effects, and Areas:</span>
If the power affects creatures directly
the result travels with the subjects for the power&rsquo;s duration. If
the
power creates an effect, the effect lasts for the duration. The effect
might move or remain still. Such an effect can be destroyed prior to
when its duration ends. If the power affects an area then the power
stays with that area for its duration. Creatures become subject to the
power when they enter the area and are no longer subject to it when
they leave.</p>
      <a id="touch-powers-and--holding-the-charge"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Touch Powers and Holding the
Charge:</span> In most cases, if you don&rsquo;t
discharge a touch power on the round you manifest it, you can hold the
charge (postpone the discharge of the power) indefinitely. You can make
touch attacks round after round. If you touch anything with your hand
while holding a charge, the power discharges. If you manifest another
power, the touch power dissipates.</p>
      <p>Some touch powers allow you to touch multiple targets as part
of the
power. You can&rsquo;t hold the charge of such a power; you must touch
all
the targets of the power in the same round that you finish manifesting
the power. You can touch one friend (or yourself) as a standard action
or as many as six friends as a full round action.</p>
      <a id="discharge"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Discharge:</span>
Occasionally a power lasts for a set duration or until
triggered or discharged.</p>
      <a id="dismissible"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(D) Dismissible:</span> If
the Duration line ends with &ldquo;(D),&rdquo; you can dismiss
the power at will. You must be within range of the power&rsquo;s effect
and
must mentally will the dismissal, which causes the same display as when
you first manifested the power. Dismissing a power is a standard action
that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A power that depends on
concentration is dismissible by its very nature, and dismissing it does
not take an action or cause a display, since all you have to do to end
the power is to stop concentrating on your turn.</p>
      <a id="saving-throw"></a><h5>SAVING THROW</h5>
Usually a harmful power allows a target to make a saving throw to avoid
some or all of the effect. The Saving Throw line in a power description
defines which type of saving throw the power allows and describes how
saving throws against the power work.<br />
      <a id="saving-throw-negates"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Negates:</span> The power has
no effect on a subject that makes a successful
saving throw.</p>
      <a id="saving-throw-partial"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Partial:</span> The power
causes an effect on its subject, such as death. A
successful saving throw means that some lesser effect occurs (such as
being dealt damage rather than being killed).</p>
      <a id="saving-throw-half"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Half:</span> The power deals
damage, and a successful saving throw halves the
damage taken (round down). </p>
      <a id="saving-throw-none"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">None:</span> No saving throw
is allowed.</p>
      <a id="saving-throw-object"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(object):</span> The power
can be manifested on objects, which receive saving
throws only if they are psionic or if they are attended (held, worn,
grasped, or the like) by a creature resisting the power, in which case
the object uses the creature&rsquo;s saving throw bonus unless its own
bonus
is greater. (This notation does not mean that a power can be manifested
only on objects. Some powers of this sort can be manifested on
creatures or objects.) A psionic item&rsquo;s saving throw bonuses are
each
equal to 2 + one-half the item&rsquo;s manifester level.</p>
      <a id="saving-throw-harmless"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(harmless):</span> The power
is usually beneficial, not harmful, but a
targeted creature can attempt a saving throw if it desires.</p>
      <a id="saving-throw-difficulty-class"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving Throw Difficulty Class:</span>
A saving throw against your power has a
DC 10 + the level of the power + your key ability modifier
(Intelligence for a psion, Wisdom for a psychic warrior, or Charisma
for a wilder). A power&rsquo;s level can vary depending on your class.
Always
use the power level applicable to your class.</p>
      <a id="succeeding-on-a-saving-throw"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Succeeding on a Saving Throw:</span>
A creature that successfully saves
against a power that has no obvious physical effects feels a hostile
force or a tingle, but cannot deduce the exact nature of the attack.
Likewise, if a creature&rsquo;s saving throw succeeds against a
targeted
power you sense that the power has failed. You do not sense when
creatures succeed on saves against effect and area powers.</p>
      <a id="failing-a-saving-throw-against-mind-affecting-powers"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Failing a Saving Throw
against Mind-Affecting Powers:</span> If you fail your
save, you are unaware that you have been affected by a power.</p>
      <a id="automatic-failures-and-successes"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Automatic Failures and
Successes:</span> A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a
saving throw is always a failure, and the power may deal damage to
exposed items (see Items Surviving after a Saving Throw, below). A
natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.</p>
      <a id="voluntarily-giving-up-a-saving-throw"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Voluntarily Giving up a
Saving Throw:</span> A creature can voluntarily forego
a saving throw and willingly accept a power&rsquo;s result. Even a
character
with a special resistance to psionics can suppress this quality.</p>
      <a id="items-surviving-after-a-saving-throw"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Items Surviving after a
Saving Throw:</span> Unless the descriptive text for
the power specifies otherwise, all items carried or worn by a creature
are assumed to survive a psionic attack. If a creature rolls a natural
1 on its saving throw against the effect, however, an exposed item is
harmed (if the attack can harm objects). Refer to Table: Items Affected
by Psionic Attacks.</p>
      <p>Determine which four objects carried or worn by the creature
are most
likely to be affected and roll randomly among them. The randomly
determined item must make a saving throw against the attack form or
take whatever damage the attack deals.</p>

      <a id="power-resistance"></a><h5>POWER RESISTANCE</h5>
Power resistance is a special defensive ability. If your power is being
resisted by a creature with power resistance, you must make a
manifester level check (d20 + manifester level) at least equal to the
creature&rsquo;s power resistance for the power to affect that
creature. The
defender&rsquo;s power resistance functions like an Armor Class against
psionic attacks. Spell resistance is equivalent to power resistance
unless the Psionics Is Different option is in use. Include any
adjustments to your manifester level on this manifester level check.
      <p>The Power Resistance line and the descriptive text of a power
description tell you whether power resistance protects creatures from
the power. In many cases, power resistance applies only when a
resistant creature is targeted by the power, not when a resistant
creature encounters a power that is already in place.</p>
      <p>The terms &ldquo;object&rdquo; and &ldquo;harmless&rdquo; mean
the same thing for
power
resistance as they do for saving throws. A creature with power
resistance must voluntarily lower the resistance (a standard action) to
be affected by a power noted as harmless. In such a case, you do not
need to make the manifester level check described above.</p>
      <a id="power-points"></a><h5>POWER POINTS</h5>
All powers have a Power Points line, indicating the power&rsquo;s cost.<br />
      <p>The psionic character class tables show how many power points
a
character has access to each day, depending on level.</p>
      <p>A power&rsquo;s cost is determined by its level, as shown
below.
Every
power&rsquo;s cost is noted in its description for ease of reference.</p>

      <a id="power-point-limit"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Power Point Limit:</span> Some
powers allow you to spend more than their base
cost to achieve an improved effect, or augment the power. The maximum
number of points you can spend on a power (for any reason) is equal to
your manifester level.<br />
      <a id="xp-cost"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">XP Cost (XP):</span> On the
same line that the power point cost of a power is
indicated, the power&rsquo;s experience point cost, if any, is noted.
Particularly powerful effects entail an experience point cost to you.
No spell or power can restore XP lost in this manner. You cannot spend
so much XP that you lose a level, so you cannot manifest a power with
an XP cost unless you have enough XP to spare. However, you can, on
gaining enough XP to attain a new level, use those XP for manifesting a
power rather than keeping them and advancing a level. The XP are
expended when you manifest the power, whether or not the manifestation
succeeds.</p>
      <a id="descriptive-text"></a><h5>DESCRIPTIVE TEXT</h5>
This portion of a power description details what the power does and how
it works. If one of the previous lines in the description included
&ldquo;see
text,&rdquo; this is where the explanation is found. If the power
you&rsquo;re
reading about is based on another power you might have to refer to a
different power for the &ldquo;see text&rdquo; information. If a power
is the
equivalent of a spell an entry of &ldquo;see spell text&rdquo; directs
you to the
appropriate spell description.<br />
      <a id="augment"></a><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Augment:</span> Many powers
have variable effects based on the number of power
points you spend when you manifest them. The more points spent, the
more powerful the manifestation. How this extra expenditure affects a
power is specific to the power. Some augmentations allow you to
increase the number of damage dice, while others extend a power&rsquo;s
duration or modify a power in unique ways. Each power that can be
augmented includes an entry giving how many power points it costs to
augment and the effects of doing so. However, you can spend only a
total number of points on a power equal to your manifester level.</p>
      <p>Augmenting a power takes place as part of another action
(manifesting a
power). Unless otherwise noted in the Augment section of an individual
power description, you can augment a power only at the time you
manifest it.</p>
