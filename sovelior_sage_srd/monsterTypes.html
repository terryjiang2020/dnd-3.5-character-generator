      <p><b><a id="DR"></a><a id="damage-reduction"></a>Damage Reduction (Ex or Su)</b>: A
creature with this
special quality ignores damage from most weapons and natural attacks.
Wounds heal immediately, or the weapon bounces off harmlessly (in
either case, the opponent knows the attack was ineffective). The
creature takes normal damage from energy attacks (even nonmagical
ones), spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A
certain kind of weapon can sometimes damage the creature normally, as
noted below.</p>
      <p>The entry indicates the amount of damage ignored (usually 5 to
15 points) and the type of weapon that negates the ability. </p>
      <p>Some monsters are vulnerable to piercing, bludgeoning, or
slashing damage. </p>
      <p>Some monsters are vulnerable to certain materials, such as
alchemical silver, adamantine, or cold-forged iron. Attacks from
weapons that are not made of the correct material have their damage
reduced, even if the weapon has an enhancement bonus.</p>
      <p>Some monsters are vulnerable to magic weapons. Any weapon with
at least a +1 magical enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls
overcomes the damage reduction of these monsters. Such creatures&rsquo;
natural weapons (but not their attacks with weapons) are treated as
magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
      <p>A few very powerful monsters are vulnerable only to epic
weapons; that is, magic weapons with at least a +6 enhancement bonus.
Such creatures&rsquo; natural weapons are also treated as epic weapons
for
the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
      <p>Some monsters are vulnerable to chaotic-, evil-, good-, or
lawful-aligned weapons. When a cleric casts align weapon, affected
weapons might gain one or more of these properties, and certain magic
weapons have these properties as well. A creature with an alignment
subtype (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) can overcome this type of
damage reduction with its natural weapons and weapons it wields as if
the weapons or natural weapons had an alignment (or alignments) that
match the subtype(s) of the creature. </p>
      <p>When a damage reduction entry has a dash (&ndash;) after the
slash,
no weapon negates the damage reduction.</p>
      <p>A few creatures are harmed by more than one kind of weapon. A
weapon of either type overcomes this damage reduction.</p>
      <p>A few other creatures require combinations of different types
of attacks to overcome their damage reduction. A weapon must be both
types to overcome this damage reduction. A weapon that is only one type
is still subject to damage reduction.</p>

      <p><b><a id="energy-drain"></a>Energy Drain (Su)</b>: This
attack saps a living opponent&rsquo;s
vital energy and happens automatically when a melee or ranged attack
hits. Each successful energy drain bestows one or more negative levels
(the creature&rsquo;s description specifies how many). If an attack
that
includes an energy drain scores a critical hit, it drains twice the
given amount. Unless otherwise specified in the creature&rsquo;s
description,
a draining creature gains 5 temporary hit points (10 on a critical hit)
for each negative level it bestows on an opponent. These temporary hit
points last for a maximum of 1 hour. An affected opponent takes a
&ndash;1
penalty on all skill checks and ability checks, attack rolls, and
saving throws, and loses one effective level or Hit Die (whenever level
is used in a die roll or calculation) for each negative level. A
spellcaster loses one spell slot of the highest level of spells she can
cast and (if applicable) one prepared spell of that level; this loss
persists until the negative level is removed. Negative levels remain
until 24 hours have passed or until they are removed with a spell, such
as restoration. If a negative level is not removed before 24 hours have
passed, the affected creature must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 +
1/2 draining creature&rsquo;s racial HD + draining creature&rsquo;s Cha
modifier;
the exact DC is given in the creature&rsquo;s descriptive text). On a
success, the negative level goes away with no harm to the creature. On
a failure, the negative level goes away, but the creature&rsquo;s level
is
also reduced by one. A separate saving throw is required for each
negative level.<br />

applied only to

also called fiends. Most creatures that have this subtype also have
evil alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain
the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature
with this subtype as if the creature has an evil alignment, no matter
what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects
according to its actual alignment. A creature with the evil subtype
overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it
wields were evil-aligned (see Damage Reduction, above).</p>

to plane. Monster entries assume that encounters with creatures take
place on the Material Plane, and every creature whose native plane is
not the Material Plane has the extraplanar subtype (but would not have
when on its home plane). Every extraplanar creature in this book has a
home plane mentioned in its description. Creatures not labeled as
extraplanar are natives of the Material Plane, and they gain the

failure.</p>
      <br />
      <p><b><a id="flight"></a>Flight (Ex or Su)</b>: A creature with
this ability can
cease or resume flight as a free action. If the ability is
supernatural, it becomes ineffective in an antimagic field, and the
creature loses its ability to fly for as long as the antimagic effect
persists.</p>
      <br />
      <p><b><a id="rightful-presence"></a>Frightful Presence (Ex)</b>:
This special quality makes a
creature&rsquo;s very presence unsettling to foes. It takes effect
automatically when the creature performs some sort of dramatic action
(such as charging, attacking, or snarling). Opponents within range who
witness the action may become frightened or shaken. Actions required to
trigger the ability are given in the creature&rsquo;s descriptive text.
The
range is usually 30 feet, and the duration is usually 5d6 rounds. This
ability affects only opponents with fewer Hit Dice or levels than the
creature has. An affected opponent can resist the effects with a
successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 frightful creature&rsquo;s racial HD
+
frightful creature&rsquo;s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the
creature&rsquo;s descriptive text). An opponent that succeeds on the
saving
throw is immune to that same creature&rsquo;s frightful presence for 24
hours. Frightful presence is a mind-affecting fear effect. </p>
      <br />
      <p><b><a id="gaze"></a>Gaze (Su)</b>: A gaze special attack
takes effect when
opponents look at the creature&rsquo;s eyes. The attack can have almost
any
sort of effect: petrification, death, charm, and so on. The typical
range is 30 feet, but check the creature&rsquo;s entry for details. The
type
of saving throw for a gaze attack varies, but it is usually a Will or
Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 gazing creature&rsquo;s racial HD + gazing
creature&rsquo;s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the
creature&rsquo;s
descriptive text). A successful saving throw negates the effect. A
monster&rsquo;s gaze attack is described in abbreviated form in its
description. Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must attempt a
saving throw each round at the beginning of his or her turn in the
initiative order. Only looking directly at a creature with a gaze
attack leaves an opponent vulnerable. Opponents can avoid the need to
make the saving throw by not looking at the creature, in one of two
ways. </p>
      <p><i>Averting Eyes</i>: The opponent avoids looking at the
creature&rsquo;s face, instead looking at its body, watching its
shadow,
tracking it in a reflective surface, and so on. Each round, the
opponent has a 50% chance to not need to make a saving throw against
the gaze attack. The creature with the gaze attack, however, gains
concealment against that opponent.</p>
      <p><i>Wearing a Blindfold</i>: The opponent cannot see the
creature at all (also possible to achieve by turning one&rsquo;s back
on the
creature or shutting one&rsquo;s eyes). The creature with the gaze
attack
gains total concealment against the opponent. </p>
      <p>A creature with a gaze attack can actively gaze as an attack
action by choosing a target within range. That opponent must attempt a
saving throw but can try to avoid this as described above. Thus, it is
possible for an opponent to save against a creature&rsquo;s gaze twice
during
the same round, once before the opponent&rsquo;s action and once during
the
creature&rsquo;s turn. </p>
      <p>Gaze attacks can affect ethereal opponents. A creature is
immune to gaze attacks of others of its kind unless otherwise noted.</p>
      <p>Allies of a creature with a gaze attack might be affected. All
the creature&rsquo;s allies are considered to be averting their eyes
from the
creature with the gaze attack, and have a 50% chance to not need to
make a saving throw against the gaze attack each round. The creature
also can veil its eyes, thus negating its gaze ability.</p>

applied only to

alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that
depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the

is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual

have few or no supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but most can
speak and usually have well-developed societies. They usually are Small

      <p>Humanoids with 1 Hit Die exchange the features of their
humanoid Hit Die for the class features of a PC or NPC class. Humanoids
of this sort are presented as 1st-level warriors, which means that they

      <p><b><a id="improved-grab"></a>Improved Grab (Ex)</b>: If a
creature with this special
attack hits with a melee weapon (usually a claw or bite attack), it
deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking an attack of opportunity. No initial touch attack is
required. Unless otherwise noted, improved grab works only against
opponents at least one size category smaller than the creature. The
creature has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use
the part of its body it used in the improved grab to hold the opponent.
If it chooses to do the latter, it takes a &ndash;20 penalty on grapple
checks, but is not considered grappled itself; the creature does not
lose its Dexterity bonus to AC, still threatens an area, and can use
its remaining attacks against other opponents. A successful hold does
not deal any extra damage unless the creature also has the constrict
special attack. If the creature does not constrict, each successful
grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the
damage indicated for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise,
it deals constriction damage as well (the amount is given in the
creature&rsquo;s descriptive text). When a creature gets a hold after
an
improved grab attack, it pulls the opponent into its space. This act
does not provoke attacks of opportunity. It can even move (possibly
carrying away the opponent), provided it can drag the opponent&rsquo;s
weight. </p>
      <br />
      <p><b><a id="incorporeal"></a>Incorporeal Subtype</b>: An
incorporeal creature has no
physical body. It can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures,
magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells,
spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. It is immune to all
nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it
has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except
for positive energy, negative energy, force effects such as magic
missile, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons). Although it is not
a magical attack, holy water can affect incorporeal undead, but a hit
with holy water has a 50% chance of not affecting an incorporeal
creature.</p>
      <p>An incorporeal creature has no natural armor bonus but has a
deflection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus (always at least +1, even
if the creature&rsquo;s Charisma score does not normally provide a
bonus). </p>
      <p>An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid
objects, but must remain adjacent to the object&rsquo;s exterior, and
so
cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than its
own. It can sense the presence of creatures or objects within a square
adjacent to its current location, but enemies have total concealment
(50% miss chance) from an incorporeal creature that is inside an
object. In order to see farther from the object it is in and attack
normally, the incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal creature
inside an object has total cover, but when it attacks a creature
outside the object it only has cover, so a creature outside with a
readied action could strike at it as it attacks. An incorporeal
creature cannot pass through a force effect.</p>
      <p>An incorporeal creature&rsquo;s attacks pass through (ignore)
natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and
force effects (such as mage armor) work normally against it.
Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as
they do in air. Incorporeal creatures cannot fall or take falling
damage. Incorporeal creatures cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor
can they be tripped or grappled. In fact, they cannot take any physical
action that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor
are they subject to such actions. Incorporeal creatures have no weight
and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight.</p>
      <p>An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be heard
with Listen checks if it doesn&rsquo;t wish to be. It has no Strength
score,
so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its melee attacks and its
ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such as scent and blindsight, are
either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal
creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction and
can move at full speed even when they cannot see.<br />

      <p><b><a id="manufactured-weapons"></a>Manufactured Weapons</b>:
Some monsters employ manufactured
weapons when they attack. Creatures that use swords, bows, spears, and
the like follow the same rules as characters, including those for
additional attacks from a high base attack bonus and two-weapon
fighting penalties. This category also includes &ldquo;found
items,&rdquo; such as
rocks and logs, that a creature wields in combat&mdash; in essence, any
weapon that is not intrinsic to the creature.</p>
      <p>Some creatures combine attacks with natural and manufactured
weapons when they make a full attack. When they do so, the manufactured
weapon attack is considered the primary attack unless the
creature&rsquo;s
description indicates otherwise and any natural weapons the creature
also uses are considered secondary natural attacks. These secondary
attacks do not interfere with the primary attack as attacking with an
off-hand weapon does, but they take the usual &ndash;5 penalty (or
&ndash;2 with
the Multiattack feat) for such attacks, even if the natural weapon used
is normally the creature&rsquo;s primary natural weapon.</p>

      <p><b><a id="movement-modes"></a>Movement Modes</b>: Creatures
may have modes of movement
other than walking and running. These are natural, not magical, unless
specifically noted in a monster description.</p>
      <p><i>Burrow</i>: A creature with a burrow speed can tunnel
through dirt, but not through rock unless the descriptive text says
otherwise. Creatures cannot charge or run while burrowing. Most
burrowing creatures do not leave behind tunnels other creatures can use
(either because the material they tunnel through fills in behind them
or because they do not actually dislocate any material when burrowing);
see the individual creature descriptions for details.</p>
      <p><i>Climb</i>: A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial
bonus on all <a href="skillsAll.html#climb"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Climb</a> checks. The creature must
make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC of more than 0,
but it always can choose to take 10 even if rushed or threatened while
climbing. The creature climbs at the given speed while climbing. If it
chooses an accelerated climb it moves at double the given climb speed
(or its base land speed, whichever is lower) and makes a single Climb
check at a &ndash;5 penalty. Creatures cannot run while climbing. A
creature
retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and
opponents get no special bonus on their attacks against a climbing
creature.</p>
      <p><i>Fly</i>: A creature with a fly speed can move through the
air at the indicated speed if carrying no more than a light load. (Note
that medium armor does not necessarily constitute a medium load.) All
fly speeds include a parenthetical note indicating maneuverability, as
follows: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Perfect: The creature can perform almost any aerial
maneuver
it wishes. It moves through the air as well as a human moves over
smooth ground.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Good: The creature is very agile in the air (like a
housefly
or a hummingbird), but cannot change direction as readily as those with
perfect maneuverability.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Average: The creature can fly as adroitly as a small bird.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Poor: The creature flies as well as a very large bird.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Clumsy: The creature can barely maneuver at all.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A creature that flies can make dive attacks. A dive attack
works just like a charge, but the diving creature must move a minimum
of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. It can make only claw or talon
attacks, but these deal double damage. A creature can use the run
action while flying, provided it flies in a straight line. </p>
      <p><i>Swim</i>: A creature with a swim speed can move through
water at its swim speed without making Swim checks. It has a +8 racial
bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a
hazard. The creature can always can choose to take 10 on a Swim check,
even if distracted or endangered. The creature can use the run action
while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. </p>
      <br />
      <p><b><a id="native"></a>Native Subtype</b>: A subtype applied
only to outsiders.
These creatures have mortal ancestors or a strong connection to the
Material Plane and can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as
other living creatures can be. Creatures with this subtype are native
to the Material Plane (hence the subtype&rsquo;s name). Unlike true
outsiders, native outsiders need to eat and sleep. </p>
      <br />
      <p><b><a id="natural-weapons"></a>Natural Weapons</b>: Natural
weapons are weapons that are
physically a part of a creature. A creature making a melee attack with
a natural weapon is considered armed and does not provoke attacks of
opportunity. Likewise, it threatens any space it can reach. Creatures
do not receive additional attacks from a high base attack bonus when
using natural weapons. The number of attacks a creature can make with
its natural weapons depends on the type of the attack&mdash;generally,
a
creature can make one bite attack, one attack per claw or tentacle, one
gore attack, one sting attack, or one slam attack (although Large
creatures with arms or arm-like limbs can make a slam attack with each
arm). Refer to the individual monster descriptions.</p>
      <p>Unless otherwise noted, a natural weapon threatens a critical
hit on a natural attack roll of 20.</p>
      <p>When a creature has more than one natural weapon, one of them
(or sometimes a pair or set of them) is the primary weapon. All the
creature&rsquo;s remaining natural weapons are secondary. </p>
      <p>The primary weapon is given in the creature&rsquo;s Attack
entry,
and the primary weapon or weapons is given first in the
creature&rsquo;s Full
Attack entry. A creature&rsquo;s primary natural weapon is its most
effective
natural attack, usually by virtue of the creature&rsquo;s physiology,
training, or innate talent with the weapon. An attack with a primary
natural weapon uses the creature&rsquo;s full attack bonus. Attacks
with
secondary natural weapons are less effective and are made with a
&ndash;5
penalty on the attack roll, no matter how many there are. (Creatures
with the Multiattack feat take only a &ndash;2 penalty on secondary
attacks.)
This penalty applies even when the creature makes a single attack with
the secondary weapon as part of the attack action or as an attack of
opportunity.</p>
      <p>Natural weapons have types just as other weapons do. The most
common are summarized below.</p>
      <p><i>Bite</i>: The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing
piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage.</p>
      <p><i>Claw or Talon</i>: The creature rips with a sharp
appendage, dealing piercing and slashing damage.</p>
      <p><i>Gore</i>: The creature spears the opponent with an antler,
horn, or similar appendage, dealing piercing damage.</p>
      <p><i>Slap or Slam</i>: The creature batters opponents with an
appendage, dealing bludgeoning damage.</p>
      <p><i>Sting</i>: The creature stabs with a stinger, dealing
piercing damage. Sting attacks usually deal damage from poison in
addition to hit point damage.</p>
      <p><i>Tentacle</i>: The creature flails at opponents with a
powerful tentacle, dealing bludgeoning (and sometimes slashing) damage.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p><b><a id="nonabilities"></a>Nonabilities</b>: Some creatures
lack certain ability
scores. These creatures do not have an ability score of 0&mdash;they
lack the
ability altogether. The modifier for a nonability is +0. Other effects
of nonabilities are detailed below.</p>
      <p><i>Strength</i>: Any creature that can physically manipulate
other objects has at least 1 point of Strength. A creature with no
Strength score can&rsquo;t exert force, usually because it has no
physical
body or because it doesn&rsquo;t move. The creature automatically fails
Strength checks. If the creature can attack, it applies its Dexterity
modifier to its base attack bonus instead of a Strength modifier.</p>
      <p><i>Dexterity</i>: Any creature that can move has at least 1
point of Dexterity. A creature with no Dexterity score can&rsquo;t
move. If
it can perform actions (such as casting spells), it applies its
Intelligence modifier to initiative checks instead of a Dexterity
modifier. The creature automatically fails Reflex saves and Dexterity
checks.</p>
      <p><i>Constitution</i>: Any living creature has at least 1 point
of Constitution. A creature with no Constitution has no body or no
metabolism. It is immune to any effect that requires a Fortitude save
unless the effect works on objects or is harmless. The creature is also
immune to ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain, and
automatically fails Constitution checks. A creature with no
Constitution cannot tire and thus can run indefinitely without tiring
(unless the creature&rsquo;s description says it cannot run).</p>
      <p><i>Intelligence</i>: Any creature that can think, learn, or
remember has at least 1 point of Intelligence. A creature with no
Intelligence score is mindless, an automaton operating on simple
instincts or programmed instructions. It has immunity to mind-affecting
effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects)
and automatically fails Intelligence checks.</p>
      <p>Mindless creatures do not gain feats or skills, although they
may have bonus feats or racial skill bonuses.</p>
      <p><i>Wisdom</i>: Any creature that can perceive its environment
in any fashion has at least 1 point of Wisdom. Anything with no Wisdom
score is an object, not a creature. Anything without a Wisdom score
also has no Charisma score.</p>
      <p><i>Charisma</i>: Any creature capable of telling the
difference between itself and things that are not itself has at least 1
point of Charisma. Anything with no Charisma score is an object, not a
creature. Anything without a Charisma score also has no Wisdom score.</p>

is
slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that restore souls to their bodies,
such as raise dead, reincarnate, and resurrection, don&rsquo;t work on
an
outsider. It takes a different magical effect, such as limited wish,
wish, miracle, or true resurrection to restore it to life. An outsider

      <p><b><a id="scent"></a>Scent (Ex)</b>: This special quality
allows a creature to
detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense
of smell. Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors
just as humans do familiar sights.</p>
      <p>The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of
smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if
downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting
garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering
scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at
triple normal range.</p>
      <p>When a creature detects a scent, the exact location of the

      <p>A creature with the Track feat and the scent ability can
follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or
follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what
kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases
depending on how strong the quarry&rsquo;s odor is, the number of
creatures,
and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC
increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track
feat. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface
conditions and poor visibility.<br />

end the effect. Stopping one&rsquo;s ears ahead of time allows
opponents to
avoid having to make saving throws against mind-affecting sonic
attacks, but not other kinds of sonic attacks (such as those that deal

wax or
other soundproof material to stuff into the ears.</p>
      <br />
      <p><b><a id="special-abilities"></a>Special Abilities</b>: A
special ability is either
extraordinary (Ex), spell-like (Sp), or supernatural (Su).</p>
      <p><i>Extraordinary</i>: Extraordinary abilities are nonmagical,
don&rsquo;t become ineffective in an antimagic field, and are not
subject to
any effect that disrupts magic. Using an extraordinary ability is a
free action unless otherwise noted.</p>
      <p><i>Spell-Like</i>: Spell-like abilities are magical and work
just like spells (though they are not spells and so have no verbal,
somatic, material, focus, or XP components). They go away in an
antimagic field and are subject to spell resistance if the spell the
ability resembles or duplicates would be subject to spell resistance.</p>
      <p>A spell-like ability usually has a limit on how often it can
be used. A spell-like ability that can be used at will has no use
limit. Using a spell-like ability is a standard action unless noted
otherwise, and doing so while threatened provokes attacks of
opportunity. It is possible to make a <a
 href="skillsAll.html#concentration" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Concentration</a>
check to use a
spell-like ability defensively and avoid provoking an attack of
opportunity, just as when casting a spell. A spell-like ability can be
disrupted just as a spell can be. Spell-like abilities cannot be used
to counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled.</p>
      <p>For creatures with spell-like abilities, a designated caster
level defines how difficult it is to dispel their spell-like effects
and to define any level-dependent variables (such as range and
duration) the abilities might have. The creature&rsquo;s caster level
never
affects which spell-like abilities the creature has; sometimes the
given caster level is lower than the level a spellcasting character
would need to cast the spell of the same name. If no caster level is
specified, the caster level is equal to the creature&rsquo;s Hit Dice.
The
saving throw (if any) against a spell-like ability is 10 + the level of
the spell the ability resembles or duplicates + the creature&rsquo;s
Cha
modifier.</p>
      <p>Some spell-like abilities duplicate spells that work
differently when cast by characters of different classes. A
monster&rsquo;s
spell-like abilities are presumed to be the sorcerer/wizard versions.
If the spell in question is not a sorcerer/wizard spell, then default
to cleric, druid, bard, paladin, and ranger, in that order.</p>
      <p><i>Supernatural</i>: Supernatural abilities are magical and go
away in an antimagic field but are not subject to spell resistance.
Supernatural abilities cannot be dispelled. Using a supernatural
ability is a standard action unless noted otherwise. Supernatural
abilities may have a use limit or be usable at will, just like
spell-like abilities. However, supernatural abilities do not provoke
attacks of opportunity and never require Concentration checks. Unless
otherwise noted, a supernatural ability has an effective caster level
equal to the creature&rsquo;s Hit Dice. The saving throw (if any)
against a
supernatural ability is 10 + 1/2 the creature&rsquo;s HD + the
creature&rsquo;s
ability modifier (usually Charisma).</p>
      <br />
      <p><b><a id="spell-immunity"></a>Spell Immunity (Ex)</b>: A
creature with spell immunity
avoids the effects of spells and spell-like abilities that directly
affect it. This works exactly like spell resistance, except that it
cannot be overcome. Sometimes spell immunity is conditional or applies
to only spells of a certain kind or level. Spells that do not allow
spell resistance are not affected by spell immunity.</p>
      <br />
      <p><b><a id="SR"></a><a id="spell-resistance"></a>Spell Resistance (Ex)</b>: A creature with
spell resistance
can avoid the effects of spells and spell-like abilities that directly
affect it.To determine if a spell or spell-like ability works against a
creature with spell resistance, the caster must make a caster level
check (1d20 + caster level). If the result equals or exceeds the
creature&rsquo;s spell resistance, the spell works normally, although
the
creature is still allowed a saving throw.<br />

      <p><b><a id="spells"></a>Spells</b>: Sometimes a creature can
cast arcane or divine
spells just as a member of a spellcasting class can (and can activate
magic items accordingly). Such creatures are subject to the same
spellcasting rules that characters are, except as follows. </p>
      <p>A spellcasting creature that lacks hands or arms can provide
any somatic component a spell might require by moving its body. Such a
creature also does need material components for its spells. The
creature can cast the spell by either touching the required component
(but not if the component is in another creature&rsquo;s possession) or
having the required component on its person. Sometimes spellcasting
creatures utilize the Eschew Materials feat to avoid fussing with
noncostly components.</p>
      <p>A spellcasting creature is not actually a member of a class
unless its entry says so, and it does not gain any class abilities. A
creature with access to cleric spells must prepare them in the normal
manner and receives domain spells if noted, but it does not receive
domain granted powers unless it has at least one level in the cleric
class.</p>
      <br />
      <p><b><a id="summon"></a>Summon (Sp)</b>: A creature with the
summon ability can
summon specific other creatures of its kind much as though casting a
summon monster spell, but it usually has only a limited chance of
success (as specified in the creature&rsquo;s entry). Roll d%: On a
failure,
no creature answers the summons. Summoned creatures automatically
return whence they came after 1 hour. A creature that has just been
summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. Most creatures
with the ability to summon do not use it lightly, since it leaves them
beholden to the summoned creature. In general, they use it only when
necessary to save their own lives. An appropriate spell level is given
for each summoning ability for purposes of <a
 href="skillsAll.html#concentration" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Concentration</a>
checks and
attempts to dispel the summoned creature. No experience points are
awarded for summoned monsters.</p>
      <br />
      <p><b><a id="swallow-whole"></a>Swallow Whole (Ex)</b>: If a
creature with this special
attack begins its turn with an opponent held in its mouth (see Improved
Grab), it can attempt a new grapple check (as though attempting to pin
the opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its prey, and the opponent
takes bite damage. Unless otherwise noted, the opponent can be up to
one size category smaller than the swallowing creature. Being swallowed
has various consequences, depending on the creature doing the
swallowing. A swallowed creature is considered to be grappled, while
the creature that did the swallowing is not. A swallowed creature can
try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (the
amount of cutting damage required to get free is noted in the creature
description), or it can just try to escape the grapple. The Armor Class
of the interior of a creature that swallows whole is normally 10 + 1/2
its natural armor bonus, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If
the swallowed creature escapes the grapple, success puts it back in the
attacker&rsquo;s mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.</p>
      <br />
      <p><b><a id="swarm"></a>Swarm Subtype</b>: A swarm is a
collection of Fine,
Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a single creature. A swarm
has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A swarm has
a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier,
a single speed, and a single Armor Class. A swarm makes saving throws
as a single creature. A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made
up of nonflying creatures) or a cube (of flying creatures) 10 feet on a
side, but its reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order
to attack, it moves into an opponent&rsquo;s space, which provokes an
attack
of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a creature of any size,
since it crawls all over its prey. A swarm can move through squares
occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the
swarm provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A swarm can move
through cracks or holes large enough for its component creatures.</p>
      <p>A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures
or 1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive creatures consists of
1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine
creatures consists of 10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not.
Swarms of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than could
normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because
creatures in a swarm are packed tightly together and generally crawl
over each other and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms
are represented by multiples of single swarms. The area occupied by a
large swarm is completely shapeable, though the swarm usually remains
in contiguous squares.</p>
      <p><i>Traits</i>: A swarm has no clear front or back and no
discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or flanking.
A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half damage from slashing and
piercing weapons. A swarm composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is
immune to all weapon damage. Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or lower
causes it to break up, though damage taken until that point does not
degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never
staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be
tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple an opponent.</p>
      <p>A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a
specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as
disintegrate), with the exception of mind-affecting effects (charms,
compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) if the swarm has
an Intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes half again as much
damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such as
splash weapons and many evocation spells.</p>
      <p>Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible
to high winds such as that created by a gust of wind spell. For
purposes of determining the effects of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm
as a creature of the same size as its constituent creatures. A swarm
rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage becomes disorganized
and dispersed, and does not reform until its hit points exceed its
nonlethal damage.</p>
      <br />
      <p><b><a id="swarm-attack"></a>Swarm Attack</b>: Creatures with
the swarm subtype don&rsquo;t
make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any
creature whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no
attack roll needed. Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss chance for

      <p>A swarm&rsquo;s attacks are nonmagical, unless the
swarm&rsquo;s
description states otherwise. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a
swarm attack&rsquo;s damage to 0, being incorporeal, and other special
abilities usually give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to
damage from a swarm. Some swarms also have acid, poison, blood drain,
or other special attacks in addition to normal damage.</p>
      <p>Swarms do not threaten creatures in their square, and do not
make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack. However, they
distract foes whose squares they occupy, as described below.</p>
      <p><i>Distraction (Ex)</i>: Any living creature vulnerable to a
swarm&rsquo;s damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its square is
nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 swarm&rsquo;s HD +
swarm&rsquo;s Con modifier; the exact DC is given in a swarm&rsquo;s
description)
negates the effect. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the
area of a swarm requires a <a href="skillsAll.html#concentration"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Concentration</a> check (DC 20 +
spell level).
Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a DC 20
Concentration check.</p>
      <br />
      <p><b><a id="telepathy"></a>Telepathy (Su)</b>: A creature with
this ability can
communicate telepathically with any other creature within a certain
range (specified in the creature&rsquo;s entry, usually 100 feet) that
has a
language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once
telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with
more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously
speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time.</p>
      <p>Some creatures have a limited form of telepathy, while others
have a more powerful form of the ability.</p>
      <br />
      <p><b><a id="trample"></a>Trample (Ex)</b>: As a full-round
action, a creature with
this special attack can move up to twice its speed and literally run
over any opponents at least one size category smaller than itself. The
creature merely has to move over the opponents in its path; any
creature whose space is completely covered by the trampling
creature&rsquo;s
space is subject to the trample attack. If a target&rsquo;s space is
larger
than 5 feet, it is only considered trampled if the trampling creature
moves over all the squares it occupies. If the trampling creature moves
over only some of a target&rsquo;s space, the target can make an attack
of
opportunity against the trampling creature at a &ndash;4 penalty. A
trampling
creature that accidentally ends its movement in an illegal space
returns to the last legal position it occupied, or the closest legal
position, if there&rsquo;s a legal position that&rsquo;s closer.</p>
      <p>A trample attack deals bludgeoning damage (the
creature&rsquo;s slam
damage + 1-1/2 times its Str modifier). The creature&rsquo;s
descriptive text
gives the exact amount.</p>
      <p>Trampled opponents can attempt attacks of opportunity, but
these take a &ndash;4 penalty. If they do not make attacks of
opportunity,
trampled opponents can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage.</p>
      <p>The save DC against a creature&rsquo;s trample attack is 10 +
1/2
creature&rsquo;s HD + creature&rsquo;s Str modifier (the exact DC is
given in the
creature&rsquo;s descriptive text). A trampling creature can only deal
trampling damage to each target once per round, no matter how many
times its movement takes it over a target creature.</p>

      <p><b><a id="treasure"></a>Treasure</b>: This entry in a
monster description describes
how much wealth a creature owns. In most cases, a creature keeps
valuables in its home or lair and has no treasure with it when it
travels. Intelligent creatures that own useful, portable treasure (such
as magic items) tend to carry and use these, leaving bulky items at
home. Treasure can include coins, goods, and items. Creatures can have
varying amounts of each, as follows.</p>
      <p><i>Standard</i>: Refer to the treasure tables and roll d% once
for each type of treasure (Coins, Goods, Items) on the Level section of
the table that corresponds to the creature&rsquo;s Challenge Rating
(for
groups of creatures, use the Encounter Level for the encounter
instead). Some creatures have double, triple, or even quadruple
standard treasure; in these cases, roll for each type of treasure two,
three, or four times.</p>
      <p><i>None</i>: The creature collects no treasure of its own.</p>
      <p><i>Nonstandard</i>: Some creatures have quirks or habits that
affect the types of treasure they collect. These creatures use the same</p>
      <p>treasure tables, but with special adjustments.</p>
      <p><i>Fractional Coins</i>: Roll on the Coins column in the
section corresponding to the creature&rsquo;s Challenge Rating, but
divide
the result as indicated.</p>
      <p><i>% Goods or Items</i>: The creature has goods or items only
some of the time. Before checking for goods or items, roll d% against
the given percentage. On a success, make a normal roll on the
appropriate Goods or Items column (which may still result in no goods
or items).</p>
      <p><i>Double Goods or Items</i>: Roll twice on the appropriate
Goods or Items column.</p>
      <p><i>Parenthetical Notes</i>: Some entries for goods or items
include notes that limit the types of treasure a creature collects.</p>
      <p>When a note includes the word &ldquo;no,&rdquo; it means the
creature does
not collect or cannot keep that thing. If a random roll generates such
a result, treat the result as &ldquo;none&rdquo; instead. </p>
      <p>When a note includes the word &ldquo;only,&rdquo; the creature
goes out of
its way to collect treasure of the indicated type. Treat all results
from that column as the indicated type of treasure.</p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s sometimes necessary to reroll until the right sort
of
item appears. </p>
