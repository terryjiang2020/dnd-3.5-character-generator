      <p>Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check
against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate
the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the item&rsquo;s

      <p>A magnifying glass gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on
Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed,
such as a gem. A merchant&rsquo;s scale gives you a +2 circumstance
bonus on
Appraise checks involving any items that are valued by weight,
including anything made of precious metals. These bonuses stack.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Appraising an item takes 1 minute (ten
consecutive full-round actions).</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: No. You cannot try again on the same object,
regardless of success.</p>

familiar with valuable items of all kinds (especially those made of

each multiple of your speed (or fraction thereof ) that you charge.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: None. A Balance check doesn&rsquo;t require an
action; it is made as part of another action or as a reaction to a
situation.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#agile"

target&rsquo;s <a href="#sense-motive"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Sense
Motive</a> check. See the accompanying table for examples of different
kinds of bluffs and the modifier to the target&rsquo;s Sense Motive
check for
each one.</p>
      <p>Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the
outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff
is hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes
against its self-interest, nature, personality, orders, or the like. If
it&rsquo;s important, you can distinguish between a bluff that fails
because
the target doesn&rsquo;t believe it and one that fails because it just
asks
too much of the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on
its Sense Motive check because the bluff demands something risky, and
the Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target
didn&rsquo;t
so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A
target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff.</p>
      <p>A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as
you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or
believes something that you want it to believe. Bluff, however, is not
a suggestion spell. </p>
      <p>A bluff requires interaction between you and the target.
Creatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed.</p>
      <a id="feinting-in-combat"></a><p><i>Feinting in Combat</i>: You can also use Bluff to mislead
an opponent in melee combat (so that it can&rsquo;t dodge your next
attack
effectively). To <a href="specialAttacks.html#feint"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">feint</a>, make a Bluff check
opposed by your target&rsquo;s Sense Motive check, but in this case,
the
target may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other
applicable modifiers. If your Bluff check result exceeds this special
Sense Motive check result, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus to
AC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This attack
must be made on or before your next turn.</p>
      <p>Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult
because it&rsquo;s harder to read a strange creature&rsquo;s body
language; you
take a &ndash;4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of
animal
Intelligence (1 or 2) it&rsquo;s even harder; you take a &ndash;8
penalty. Against
a nonintelligent creature, it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
      <p>Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
      <a id="creating-a-diversion-to-hide"></a><p><i>Creating a Diversion to Hide</i>: You can use the Bluff
skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the
momentary diversion you need to attempt a <a href="#hide"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Hide</a> check while people are
aware of you. This usage does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
      <a id="delivering-a-secret-message"></a><p><i>Delivering a Secret Message</i>: You can use Bluff to get a
message across to another character without others understanding it.
The DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages,
especially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure
by 4 or less means you can&rsquo;t get the message across. Failure by 5
or
more means that some false information has been implied or inferred.
Anyone listening to the exchange can make a Sense Motive check opposed
by the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your
message (see Sense Motive).</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. A Bluff check made as part of general
interaction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a full-round
action), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A
Bluff check made to feint in combat or create a diversion to hide is a
standard action. A Bluff check made to deliver a secret message
doesn&rsquo;t
take an action; it is part of normal communication.</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. Generally, a failed Bluff check in
social interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to try again
in the same circumstances, but you may retry freely on Bluff checks
made to feint in combat. Retries are also allowed when you are trying
to send a message, but you may attempt such a retry only once per
round. Each retry carries the same chance of miscommunication.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A ranger gains a bonus on Bluff checks when
using this skill against a favored enemy.</p>
      <p>The master of a snake familiar gains a +3 bonus on Bluff
checks.</p>

      <p>You need both hands free to climb, but you may cling to a wall
with one hand while you cast a spell or take some other action that
requires only one hand. While climbing, you can&rsquo;t move to avoid a
blow,
so you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). You also can&rsquo;t
use a
shield while climbing.</p>
      <p>Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check
against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your
current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage.</p>
      <a id="accelerated-climbing"></a><p><i>Accelerated Climbing</i>: You try to climb more quickly
than normal. By accepting a &ndash;5 penalty, you can move half your
speed
(instead of one-quarter your speed).</p>
      <a id="making-your-own-handholds-and-footholds"></a><p><i>Making Your Own Handholds and Footholds</i>: You can make
your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing
so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of
distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a
wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with
a handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an ice wall.</p>
      <a id="catching-yourself-when-falling"></a><p><i>Catching Yourself When Falling</i>: It&rsquo;s practically
impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb
check (DC = wall&rsquo;s DC + 20) to do so. It&rsquo;s much easier to
catch
yourself on a slope (DC = slope&rsquo;s DC + 10).</p>
      <a id="catching-a-falling-character-while-climbing"></a><p><i>Catching a Falling Character While Climbing</i>: If someone
climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch
the falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing so
requires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character
(though he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if
desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC =
wall&rsquo;s DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling
character, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot
exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail
your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character&rsquo;s
fall
but don&rsquo;t lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more,
you
fail to stop the character&rsquo;s fall and begin falling as well.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Climbing is part of movement, so it&rsquo;s
generally
part of a move action (and may be combined with other types of movement
in a move action). Each move action that includes any climbing requires
a separate Climb check. Catching yourself or another falling character
doesn&rsquo;t take an action.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: You can use a rope to haul a character upward
(or lower a character) through sheer strength. You can lift double your
maximum load in this manner.</p>
      <p>A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks because
halflings are agile and surefooted.</p>
      <p>The master of a lizard familiar gains a +3 bonus on Climb
checks.</p>
      <p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#athletic"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Athletic</a> feat, you get a +2
bonus on Climb checks.</p>
      <p>A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all
Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or
slope with a DC higher than 0, but it always can choose to take 10,
even if rushed or threatened while climbing. If a creature with a climb
speed chooses an accelerated climb (see above), it moves at double its
climb speed (or at its land speed, whichever is slower) and makes a
single Climb check at a &ndash;5 penalty. Such a creature retains its
Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents
get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however,
use the run action while climbing.</p>
      <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in <a
 href="#use-rope" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Use Rope</a>, you
get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or
a rope-and-wall combination.</p>
      <h5><a id="concentration">CONCENTRATION (CON)</a></h5>
      <p class="initial">Check: You must make a Concentration check
whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by
harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires
your full attention. Such actions include casting a spell,
concentrating on an active spell, directing a spell, using a spell-like
ability, or using a skill that would provoke an attack of opportunity.
In general, if an action wouldn&rsquo;t normally provoke an attack of
opportunity, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being
distracted.</p>
      <p>If the Concentration check succeeds, you may continue with the
action as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails
and is wasted. If you were in the process of casting a spell, the spell
is lost. If you were concentrating on an active spell, the spell ends
as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were directing a
spell, the direction fails but the spell remains active. If you were
using a spell-like ability, that use of the ability is lost. A skill
use also fails, and in some cases a failed skill check may have other
ramifications as well.</p>
      <p>The table below summarizes various types of distractions that
cause you to make a Concentration check. If the distraction occurs
while you are trying to cast a spell, you must add the level of the
spell you are trying to cast to the appropriate Concentration DC. If
more than one type of distraction is present, make a check for each
one; any failed Concentration check indicates that the task is not
completed.</p>

      <p><b>Action</b>: None. Making a Concentration check
doesn&rsquo;t take
an action; it is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or
part of another action (when attempted actively).</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes, though a success doesn&rsquo;t cancel
the
effect of a previous failure, such as the loss of a spell you were
casting or the disruption of a spell you were concentrating on.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: You can use Concentration to cast a spell, use
a spell-like ability, or use a skill defensively, so as to avoid
attacks of opportunity altogether. This doesn&rsquo;t apply to other
actions
that might provoke attacks of opportunity. The DC of the check is 15
(plus the spell&rsquo;s level, if casting a spell or using a spell-like
ability defensively). If the Concentration check succeeds, you may
attempt the action normally without provoking any attacks of
opportunity. A successful Concentration check still doesn&rsquo;t allow
you
to take 10 on another check if you are in a stressful situation; you
must make the check normally. If the Concentration check fails, the
related action also automatically fails (with any appropriate
ramifications), and the action is wasted, just as if your concentration
had been disrupted by a distraction. </p>

      <h5><a id="craft">CRAFT (INT)</a></h5>
      <p class="initial">Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft
is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft
skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.</p>
      <p>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something.
If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the
heading of a Profession skill.</p>
      <p><b>Check</b>: You can practice your trade and make a decent
living, earning about half your check result in gold pieces per week of
dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to
perform the craft&rsquo;s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained
helpers,
and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants
earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)</p>
      <p>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow
you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the
complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and
the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular
item. The item&rsquo;s finished price also determines the cost of raw
materials.</p>
      <p>In some cases, the fabricate spell can be used to achieve the
results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. However, you
must make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make
articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.</p>
      <p>A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction
with the casting of the ironwood spell enables you to make wooden items
that have the strength of steel.</p>
      <p>When casting the spell minor creation, you must succeed on an
appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.</p>
      <p>All crafts require artisan&rsquo;s tools to give the best
chance of
success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a
&ndash;2
circumstance penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan&rsquo;s
tools
provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>
      <p>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item,
follow these steps.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Find the item&rsquo;s price. Put the price in silver pieces
(1 gp
= 10 sp).</li>
        <li>Find the DC from the table below.</li>
        <li>Pay one-third of the item&rsquo;s price for the cost of raw
materials.</li>
        <li>Make an appropriate Craft check representing one
week&rsquo;s
work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If
the result &times; the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you
have completed the item. (If the result &times; the DC equals double or
triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you&rsquo;ve
completed
the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the
DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result &times; the DC
doesn&rsquo;t equal the price, then it represents the progress
you&rsquo;ve made
this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next
week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the
price of the item in silver pieces.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this
week.</p>
      <p>If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and
have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
      <a id="craft-progress-by-the-day"></a><p><i>Progress by the Day</i>: You can make checks by the day
instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result
&times; DC) is in copper pieces instead of silver pieces.</p>
      <a id="creating-masterwork-items"></a><p><i>Creating Masterwork Items</i>: You can make a masterwork
item&mdash;a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a
bonus on
its use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being
magical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork
component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard
item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon
or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once
both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed,
the masterwork item is finished. Note: The cost you pay for the
masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is
for the cost in raw materials.</p>
      <a id="repairing-items"></a><p><i>Repairing Items</i>: Generally, you can repair an item by
making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the
first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the
item&rsquo;s
price. </p>
      <p>When you use the Craft skill to make a particular sort of
item, the DC for checks involving the creation of that item are
typically as given on the following table.</p>

you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw
material cost again.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A dwarf has a +2 racial bonus on Craft checks

      <p>To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have
alchemical equipment and be a spellcaster. If you are working in a
city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to
make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to
come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist&rsquo;s
lab
grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you
have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of
any items made using the skill.</p>

texts, and 30 or higher for intricate, exotic, or very old writing.</p>
      <p>If the check succeeds, you understand the general content of a
piece of writing about one page long (or the equivalent). If the check
fails, make a DC 5 Wisdom check to see if you avoid drawing a false
conclusion about the text. (Success means that you do not draw a false
conclusion; failure means that you do.)</p>
      <p>Both the Decipher Script check and (if necessary) the Wisdom
check are made secretly, so that you can&rsquo;t tell whether the
conclusion
you draw is true or false.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Deciphering the equivalent of a single page of
script takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round actions).</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: No.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A character with the <a
 href="featsAll.html#diligent" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Diligent</a>

Script, you get a +2 bonus on <a href="#use-magic-device"

      <h5><a id="diplomacy">DIPLOMACY (CHA)</a></h5>
      <p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: You can change the attitudes of
others (nonplayer characters) with a successful Diplomacy check; see
the Influencing NPC Attitudes sidebar, below, for basic DCs. In
negotiations, participants roll opposed Diplomacy checks, and the
winner gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve situations when
two advocates or diplomats plead opposite cases in a hearing before a
third party.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Changing others&rsquo; attitudes with Diplomacy
generally takes at least 1 full minute (10 consecutive full-round
actions). In some situations, this time requirement may greatly
increase. A rushed Diplomacy check can be made as a full-round action,
but you take a &ndash;10 penalty on the check.</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: Optional, but not recommended because
retries usually do not work. Even if the initial Diplomacy check
succeeds, the other character can be persuaded only so far, and a retry
may do more harm than good. If the initial check fails, the other
character has probably become more firmly committed to his position,
and a retry is futile.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A half-elf has a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy
checks.</p>
      <p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#negotiator"

      <p><b>Action</b>: The amount of time needed to make a Disable
Device check depends on the task, as noted above. Disabling a simple
device takes 1 round and is a full-round action. An intricate or
complex device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds.</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. You can retry if you have missed the
check by 4 or less, though you must be aware that you have failed in
order to try again.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: If you have the <a
 href="featsAll.html#nimble-fingers" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Nimble
Fingers</a> feat, you get a +2 bonus on Disable Device checks.</p>
      <p>A rogue who beats a trap&rsquo;s DC by 10 or more can study
the
trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (along with her
companions) without disarming it.</p>
      <p><b>Restriction</b>: Rogues (and other characters with the
trapfinding class feature) can disarm magic traps. A magic trap
generally has a DC of 25 + the spell level of the magic used to create
it.</p>
      <p>The spells fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol, and
teleportation circle also create traps that a rogue can disarm with a
successful Disable Device check. Spike growth and spike stones,
however, create magic traps against which Disable Device checks do not
succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.</p>
      <a id="other-ways-to-beat-a-trap"></a><h6>Other Ways to Beat a Trap</h6>
      <p class="initial">It&rsquo;s possible to ruin many traps without
making a Disable Device check.</p>
      <a id="beating-ranged-attack-traps"></a><p><b>Ranged Attack Traps</b>: Once a trap&rsquo;s location is
known,
the obvious way to ruin it is to smash the mechanism&mdash;assuming the
mechanism can be accessed. Failing that, it&rsquo;s possible to plug up
the
holes from which the projectiles emerge. Doing this prevents the trap
from firing unless its ammunition does enough damage to break through
the plugs.</p>
      <a id="beating-melee-attack-traps"></a><p><b>Melee Attack Traps</b>: These devices can be thwarted by
smashing the mechanism or blocking the weapons, as noted above.
Alternatively, if a character studies the trap as it triggers, he might
be able to time his dodges just right to avoid damage. A character who
is doing nothing but studying a trap when it first goes off gains a +4
dodge bonus against its attacks if it is triggered again within the
next minute.</p>
      <a id="beating-pits"></a><p><b>Pits</b>: Disabling a pit trap generally ruins only the
trapdoor, making it an uncovered pit. Filling in the pit or building a
makeshift bridge across it is an application of manual labor, not the
Disable Device skill. Characters could neutralize any spikes at the
bottom of a pit by attacking them&mdash;they break just as daggers do.</p>
      <a id="beating-magic-traps"></a><p><b>Magic Traps</b>: Dispel magic helps here. Someone who
succeeds on a caster level check against the level of the trap&rsquo;s
creator suppresses the trap for 1d4 rounds. This works only with a
targeted dispel magic, not the area version (see the spell description).</p>

      <h5><a id="forgery">FORGERY (INT)</a></h5>
      <p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: Forgery requires writing
materials appropriate to the document being forged, enough light or
sufficient visual acuity to see the details of what you&rsquo;re
writing, wax
for seals (if appropriate), and some time. To forge a document on which
the handwriting is not specific to a person (military orders, a
government decree, a business ledger, or the like), you need only to
have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your
check. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to
copy, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. To forge a longer document
written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of that
person&rsquo;s handwriting is needed.</p>
      <p>The Forgery check is made secretly, so that you&rsquo;re not
sure
how good your forgery is. As with <a href="#disguise"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Disguise</a>, you don&rsquo;t even
need to
make a check until someone examines the work. Your Forgery check is

      <p>A document that contradicts procedure, orders, or previous
knowledge, or one that requires sacrifice on the part of the person
checking the document can increase that character&rsquo;s suspicion
(and thus
create favorable circumstances for the checker&rsquo;s opposing Forgery
check).</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Forging a very short and simple document takes
about 1 minute. A longer or more complex document takes 1d4 minutes per
page.</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: Usually, no. A retry is never possible after
a particular reader detects a particular forgery. But the document
created by the forger might still fool someone else. The result of a
Forgery check for a particular document must be used for every instance
of a different reader examining the document. No reader can attempt to
detect a particular forgery more than once; if that one opposed check
goes in favor of the forger, then the reader can&rsquo;t try using his
own
skill again, even if he&rsquo;s suspicious about the document.</p>

wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the
DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task
or trick on its next action.</p>
      <a id="pushing-an-animal"></a><p><i>&ldquo;Push&rdquo; an Animal</i>: To push an animal means

capable
of performing. This category also covers making an animal perform a
forced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep
cycles. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or
ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds,
the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.</p>
      <a id="teach-an-animal-a-trick"></a><p><i>Teach an Animal a Trick</i>: You can teach an animal a
specific trick with one week of work and a successful Handle Animal
check against the indicated DC. An animal with an Intelligence score of
1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an
Intelligence score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible
tricks (and their associated DCs) include, but are not necessarily
limited to, the following.</p>
      <a id="animal-trick-attack"></a><p>Attack (DC 20): The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may
point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and
it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids,
monstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to
attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and
aberrations) counts as two tricks.</p>
      <a id="animal-trick-come"></a><p>Come (DC 15): The animal comes to you, even if it normally
would not do so.</p>
      <a id="animal-trick-defend"></a><p>Defend (DC 20): The animal defends you (or is ready to defend
you if no threat is present), even without any command being given.
Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other
character.</p>
      <a id="animal-trick-down"></a><p>Down (DC 15): The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise
backs down. An animal that doesn&rsquo;t know this trick continues to
fight
until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its
opponent is defeated.</p>
      <a id="animal-trick-fetch"></a><p>Fetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets something. If you do
not point out a specific item, the animal fetches some random object.</p>
      <a id="animal-trick-guard"></a><p>Guard (DC 20): The animal stays in place and prevents others
from approaching.</p>
      <a id="animal-trick-heel"></a><p>Heel (DC 15): The animal follows you closely, even to places
where it normally wouldn&rsquo;t go.</p>
      <a id="animal-trick-perform"></a><p>Perform (DC 15): The animal performs a variety of simple
tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.</p>
      <a id="animal-trick-seek"></a><p>Seek (DC 15): The animal moves into an area and looks around
for anything that is obviously alive or animate.</p>
      <a id="animal-trick-stay"></a><p>Stay (DC 15): The animal stays in place, waiting for you to
return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by,</p>
      <p>though it still defends itself if it needs to.</p>
      <a id="animal-trick-track"></a><p>Track (DC 20): The animal tracks the scent presented to it.
(This requires the animal to have the scent ability)</p>
      <a id="animal-trick-work"></a><p>Work (DC 15): The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy
load.</p>
      <a id="train-an-animal-for-a-purpose"></a><p><i>Train an Animal for a Purpose</i>: Rather than teaching an
animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general
purpose. Essentially, an animal&rsquo;s purpose represents a
preselected set
of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or
heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all
tricks included in the training package. If the package includes more
than three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2.</p>
      <p>An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though
if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and
beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training
an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual
tricks does, but no less time. </p>
      <a id="animal-purpose-combat-riding"></a><p>Combat Riding (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into
combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel.
Training an animal for combat riding takes six weeks. You may also
&ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; an animal trained for riding to one trained for
combat riding
by spending three weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal
check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the
animal&rsquo;s previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Warhorses
and
riding dogs are already trained to bear riders into combat, and they
don&rsquo;t require any additional training for this purpose.</p>
      <a id="animal-purpose-fighting"></a><p>Fighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows
the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting
takes three weeks.</p>
      <a id="animal-purpose-guarding"></a><p>Guarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the tricks
attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes
four weeks.</p>
      <a id="animal-purpose-heavy-labor"></a><p>Heavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor knows
the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes two
weeks.</p>
      <a id="animal-purpose-hunting"></a><p>Hunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the
tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal
for hunting takes six weeks.</p>
      <a id="animal-purpose-performance"></a><p>Performance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance knows
the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for
performance takes five weeks.</p>
      <a id="animal-purpose-riding"></a><p>Riding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows the
tricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for riding takes three
weeks.</p>
      <a id="rear-a-wild-animal"></a><p><i>Rear a Wild Animal</i>: To rear an animal means to raise a
wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler
can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once. A
successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time
it&rsquo;s being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated animal
later.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Handling an animal is a move action,
while pushing an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or ranger can
handle her animal companion as a free action or push it as a move
action.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must
spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being
handled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the
Handle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear,
or train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching,
rearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the
remainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training.
If the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to
completion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal
automatically fails.</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes, except for rearing an animal.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: You can use this skill on a creature with an
Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any
such check increases by 5. Such creatures have the same limit on tricks
known as animals do.</p>
      <p>A druid or ranger gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Handle
Animal checks involving her animal companion. In addition, a
druid&rsquo;s or
ranger&rsquo;s animal companion knows one or more bonus tricks, which
don&rsquo;t
count against the normal limit on tricks known and don&rsquo;t require
any
training time or Handle Animal checks to teach.</p>

      <p><b>Untrained</b>: If you have no ranks in Handle Animal, you
can use a Charisma check to handle and push domestic animals, but you
can&rsquo;t teach, rear, or train animals. A druid or ranger with no

      <p>A creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell
must succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by

      <a id="treat-poison"></a><p><i>Treat Poison</i>: To treat poison means to tend a single
character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage
from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned
character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal
check. The poisoned character uses your check result or his or her
saving throw, whichever is higher.</p>
      <a id="treat-disease"></a><p><i>Treat Disease</i>: To treat a disease means to tend a

      <p><b>Action</b>: Providing first aid, treating a wound, or
treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a

Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large &ndash;4, Huge &ndash;8,
Gargantuan &ndash;12,
Colossal &ndash;16.</p>
      <p>You need cover or concealment in order to attempt a Hide
check. Total cover or total concealment usually (but not always; see
Special, below) obviates the need for a Hide check, since nothing can
see you anyway.</p>
      <p>If people are observing you, even casually, you can&rsquo;t
hide.
You can run around a corner or behind cover so that you&rsquo;re out of
sight
and then hide, but the others then know at least where you went. If
your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff check;
see below), though, you can attempt to hide. While the others turn
their attention from you, you can attempt a Hide check if you can get
to a hiding place of some kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding
place has to be within 1 foot per rank you have in Hide.) This check,
however, is made at a &ndash;10 penalty because you have to move fast.</p>
      <a id="sniping"></a><p><i>Sniping</i>: If you&rsquo;ve already successfully hidden at
least
10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged attack, then
immediately hide again. You take a &ndash;20 penalty on your Hide check
to
conceal yourself after the shot.</p>
      <p><i>Creating a Diversion to Hide</i>: You can use Bluff to help
you hide. A successful Bluff check can give you the momentary diversion
you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Usually none. Normally, you make a Hide check
as part of movement, so it doesn&rsquo;t take a separate action.
However,
hiding immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a move
action.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: If you are <a
 href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#invisible"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">invisible</a>, you gain a +40 bonus
on Hide checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Hide checks if
you&rsquo;re moving.</p>
      <p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#stealthy"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Stealthy</a> feat, you get a +2
bonus on Hide checks.</p>
      <p>A 13th-level ranger can attempt a Hide check in any sort of
natural terrain, even if it doesn&rsquo;t grant cover or concealment. A
17th-level ranger can do this even while being observed.</p>
      <h5><a id="intimidate">INTIMIDATE (CHA)</a></h5>
      <p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: You can change another&rsquo;s
behavior with a successful check. Your Intimidate check is opposed by
the target&rsquo;s modified level check (1d20 + character level or Hit
Dice +
target&rsquo;s Wisdom bonus [if any] + target&rsquo;s modifiers on
saves against
fear). If you beat your target&rsquo;s check result, you may treat the
target
as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains
intimidated. (That is, the target retains its normal attitude, but will
chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while
intimidated. See the <a href="#diplomacy"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Diplomacy</a> skill, above, for
additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in
your presence, and for 1d6&times;10 minutes afterward. After this time,
the target&rsquo;s default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly
(or, if
normally unfriendly, to hostile).</p>
      <p>If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you
with incorrect or useless information, or otherwise frustrates your
efforts.</p>
      <a id="demoralize-opponent"></a><p><i>Demoralize Opponent</i>: You can also use Intimidate to
weaken an opponent&rsquo;s resolve in combat. To do so, make an
Intimidate
check opposed by the target&rsquo;s modified level check (see above).
If you
win, the target becomes <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#shaken"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">shaken</a> for 1 round. A shaken
character takes a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and
saving throws. You can intimidate only an opponent that you threaten in
melee combat and that can see you.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Changing another&rsquo;s behavior
requires 1
minute of interaction. Intimidating an opponent in combat is a standard
action.</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: Optional, but not recommended because
retries usually do not work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the
other character can be intimidated only so far, and a retry
doesn&rsquo;t
help. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably
become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and a retry is
futile.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: You gain a +4 bonus on your Intimidate check
for every size category that you are larger than your target.
Conversely, you take a &ndash;4 penalty on your Intimidate check for
every
size category that you are smaller than your target.</p>
      <p>A character immune to fear can&rsquo;t be intimidated, nor can
nonintelligent creatures.</p>
      <p>If you have the <a href="featsAll.html#persuasive"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Persuasive</a> feat, you get a +2
bonus on Intimidate checks.</p>
      <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in <a
 href="#bluff" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Bluff</a>, you get a
+2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</p>
      <h5><a id="jump">JUMP (STR; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)</a></h5>
      <p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: The DC and the distance you can
cover vary according to the type of jump you are attempting (see below).</p>
      <p>Your Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30
feet then no modifier based on speed applies to the check. If your
speed is less than 30 feet, you take a &ndash;6 penalty for every 10
feet of
speed less than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you
gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet.</p>
      <p>All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start,
which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before
attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the
jump is doubled.</p>
      <p>Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal
maximum movement in a round.</p>
      <p>If you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you
land on your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check
untrained, you land <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#prone"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">prone</a> unless you beat the DC by
5 or more.</p>
      <a id="long-jump"></a><p><i>Long Jump</i>: A long jump is a horizontal jump, made
across a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you
attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal
distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet).</p>
      <p>If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end.
If you fail the check by less than 5, you don&rsquo;t clear the
distance, but
you can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You
end your movement grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling
over a chasm or gap, getting up requires a move action and a DC 15
Climb check.</p>

      <h5><a id="knowledge">KNOWLEDGE (INT; TRAINED ONLY)</a></h5>
      <p class="initial">Like the Craft and Profession skills,
Knowledge actually encompasses a number of unrelated skills. Knowledge
represents a study of some body of lore, possibly an academic or even
scientific discipline.</p>
      <p>Below are listed typical fields of study.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane
symbols, cryptic phrases, constructs, dragons, magical beasts)</li>
        <li>Architecture and engineering (buildings, aqueducts,
bridges, fortifications)</li>
        <li>Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)</li>
        <li>Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)</li>
        <li>History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of
cities)</li>
        <li>Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs,
traditions, humanoids)</li>
        <li>Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants,
seasons and cycles, weather, vermin)</li>
        <li>Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family trees,

        <li>Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic
tradition, holy symbols, undead)</li>

      <p><b>Check</b>: Answering a question within your field of study
has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions),
or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).</p>
      <p>In many cases, you can use this skill to identify monsters and
their special powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a
check equals 10 + the monster&rsquo;s HD. A successful check allows you
to
remember a bit of useful information about that monster. For every 5
points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another
piece of useful information.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowledge
check doesn&rsquo;t take an action&mdash;you simply know the answer or
you don&rsquo;t.</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: No. The check represents what you know, and

      <p>A masterwork musical instrument gives you a +2 circumstance
bonus on Perform checks that involve its use.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in
public requires anywhere from an evening&rsquo;s work to a full
day&rsquo;s
performance. The bard&rsquo;s special Perform-based abilities are
described
in that class&rsquo;s description.</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes. Retries are allowed, but they
don&rsquo;t
negate previous failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in
the past is likely to be prejudiced against future performances.
(Increase the DC by 2 for each previous failure.)</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A bard must have at least 3 ranks in a Perform
skill to inspire courage in his allies, or to use his countersong or
his fascinate ability. A bard needs 6 ranks in a Perform skill to
inspire competence, 9 ranks to use his suggestion ability, 12 ranks to
inspire greatness, 15 ranks to use his song of freedom ability, 18
ranks to inspire heroics, and 21 ranks to use his mass suggestion
ability. See Bardic Music in the bard class description.</p>
      <p>In addition to using the Perform skill, you can entertain
people with sleight of hand, tumbling, tightrope walking, and spells
(especially illusions).</p>
      <h5><a id="profession">PROFESSION (WIS; TRAINED ONLY)</a></h5>
      <p class="initial">Like Craft, Knowledge, and Perform, Profession
is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several
Profession skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a
separate skill. While a Craft skill represents ability in creating or
making an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation
requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge. </p>
      <p><b>Check</b>: You can practice your trade and make a decent
living, earning about half your Profession check result in gold pieces
per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your
trade, how to perform the profession&rsquo;s daily tasks, how to
supervise
helpers, and how to handle common problems.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Not applicable. A single check generally
represents a week of work.</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. An attempt to use a Profession skill
to earn an income cannot be retried. You are stuck with whatever weekly
wage your check result brought you. Another check may be made after a
week to determine a new income for the next period of time. An attempt
to accomplish some specific task can usually be retried.</p>
      <p><b>Untrained</b>: Untrained laborers and assistants (that is,
characters without any ranks in Profession) earn an average of 1 silver
piece per day.</p>

falling damage. This usage does not take an action.</p>

whichever is
lower, to see how far the creature can jump. If you fail your Ride

      <a id="spur-mount"></a><p><i>Spur Mount</i>: You can spur your mount to greater speed

speed
by 10 feet for 1 round but deals 1 point of damage to the creature. You
can use this ability every round, but each consecutive round of
additional speed deals twice as much damage to the mount as the
previous round (2 points, 4 points, 8 points, and so on).</p>
      <a id="control-mount-in-battle"></a><p><i>Control Mount in Battle</i>: As a move action, you can
attempt to control a light horse, pony, heavy horse, or other mount not
trained for combat riding while in battle. If you fail the Ride check,
you can do nothing else in that round. You do not need to roll for
warhorses or warponies.</p>
      <a id="fast-mount-and-dismount"></a><p><i>Fast Mount or Dismount</i>: You can attempt to mount or
dismount from a mount of up to one size category larger than yourself
as a free action, provided that you still have a move action available
that round. If you fail the Ride check, mounting or dismounting is a
move action. You can&rsquo;t use fast mount or dismount on a mount more
than
one size category larger than yourself.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Mounting or dismounting normally is a

a +2 bonus on Survival checks to find or follow tracks.</p>
      <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and
engineering), you get a +2 bonus on Search checks to find secret doors
or hidden compartments.</p>
      <p><b>Restriction</b>: While anyone can use Search to find a trap
whose DC is 20 or lower, only a rogue can use Search to locate traps
with higher DCs. (Exception: The spell find traps temporarily enables a
cleric to use the Search skill as if he were a rogue.)</p>
      <p>A dwarf, even one who is not a rogue, can use the Search skill
to find a difficult trap (one with a DC higher than 20) if the trap is
built into or out of stone. He gains a +2 racial bonus on the Search

      <a id="hunch"></a><p><i>Hunch</i>: This use of the skill involves making a gut
assessment of the social situation. You can get the feeling from
another&rsquo;s behavior that something is wrong, such as when
you&rsquo;re talking
to an impostor. Alternatively, you can get the feeling that someone is
trustworthy.</p>
      <a id="sense-enchantment"></a><p><i>Sense Enchantment</i>: You can tell that someone&rsquo;s

is being influenced by an enchantment effect (by definition, a
mind-affecting effect), even if that person isn&rsquo;t aware of it.
The
usual DC is 25, but if the target is dominated (see dominate person),
the DC is only 15 because of the limited range of the target&rsquo;s
activities.</p>
      <a id="discern-secret-message"></a><p><i>Discern Secret Message</i>: You may use Sense Motive to
detect that a hidden message is being transmitted via the Bluff skill.
In this case, your Sense Motive check is opposed by the Bluff check of
the character transmitting the message. For each piece of information
relating to the message that you are missing, you take a &ndash;2
penalty on
your Sense Motive check. If you succeed by 4 or less, you know that
something hidden is being communicated, but you can&rsquo;t learn
anything
specific about its content. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you
intercept and understand the message. If you fail by 4 or less, you
don&rsquo;t detect any hidden communication. If you fail by 5 or more,
you
infer some false information.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Trying to gain information with Sense Motive
generally takes at least 1 minute, and you could spend a whole evening

      <p class="initial"><b>Check</b>: A DC 10 Sleight of Hand check
lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a minor feat
of legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10
unless an observer is determined to note where the item went.</p>
      <p>When you use this skill under close observation, your skill
check is opposed by the observer&rsquo;s <a href="#spot"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Spot</a> check. The observer&rsquo;s
success doesn&rsquo;t prevent you from performing the action, just from
doing
it unnoticed.</p>
      <p>You can hide a small object (including a light weapon or an
easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand
crossbow) on your body. Your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the
Spot check of anyone observing you or the <a href="#search"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Search</a> check of anyone frisking
you. In the latter case, the searcher gains a +4 bonus on the Search
check, since it&rsquo;s generally easier to find such an object than to
hide
it. A dagger is easier to hide than most light weapons, and grants you
a +2 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it. An
extraordinarily small object, such as a coin, shuriken, or ring, grants
you a +4 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it, and heavy
or baggy clothing (such as a cloak) grants you a +2 bonus on the check.
Drawing a hidden weapon is a standard action and doesn&rsquo;t provoke
an
attack of opportunity.</p>
      <p>If you try to take something from another creature, you must
make a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to obtain it. The opponent makes a
Spot check to detect the attempt, opposed by the same Sleight of Hand
check result you achieved when you tried to grab the item. An opponent
who succeeds on this check notices the attempt, regardless of whether
you got the item.</p>
      <p>You can also use Sleight of Hand to entertain an audience as
though you were using the Perform skill. In such a case, your
&ldquo;act&rdquo;
encompasses elements of legerdemain, juggling, and the like.</p>

speaker&rsquo;s lips. If the check fails by 5 or more, you draw some
incorrect conclusion about the speech. The check is rolled secretly in
this case, so that you don&rsquo;t know whether you succeeded or missed
by 5.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Every time you have a chance to spot
something in a reactive manner you can make a Spot check without using
an action. Trying to spot something you failed to see previously is a
move action. To read lips, you must concentrate for a full minute
before making a Spot check, and you can&rsquo;t perform any other
action
(other than moving at up to half speed) during this minute.</p>
      <p><b>Try Again</b>: Yes. You can try to spot something that you
failed to see previously at no penalty. You can attempt to read lips
once per minute.</p>

progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.</p>

or because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold
your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to
your Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take
move actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a
full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the
duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round.
(Effectively, a character in combat can hold his or her breath only
half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC
10 Constitution check every round to continue holding your breath. Each

      <a id="secure-grappling-hook"></a><p><i>Secure a Grappling Hook</i>: Securing a grappling hook
requires a Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 for every 10 feet of distance the
grappling hook is thrown, to a maximum DC of 20 at 50 feet). Failure by
4 or less indicates that the hook fails to catch and falls, allowing
you to try again. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the grappling
hook initially holds, but comes loose after 1d4 rounds of supporting
weight. This check is made secretly, so that you don&rsquo;t know
whether the
rope will hold your weight.</p>
      <a id="bind-a-character"></a><p><i>Bind a Character</i>: When you bind another character with
a rope, any Escape Artist check that the bound character makes is
opposed by your Use Rope check. You get a +10 bonus on this check
because it is easier to bind someone than to escape from bonds. You
don&rsquo;t even make your Use Rope check until someone tries to escape.</p>
      <p><b>Action</b>: Varies. Throwing a grappling hook is a standard
action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Tying a knot, tying a
special knot, or tying a rope around yourself one-handed is a
full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Splicing two
ropes together takes 5 minutes. Binding a character takes 1 minute.</p>
      <p><b>Special</b>: A silk rope gives you a +2 circumstance bonus
on Use Rope checks. If you cast an animate rope spell on a rope, you
get a +2 circumstance bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using
that rope. These bonuses stack.</p>
      <p>If you have the Deft Hands feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use
Rope checks.</p>
      <p><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you
get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or
a rope-and-wall combination.</p>
      <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on
      <a href="#escape-artist" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Escape
Artist</a> checks when escaping from rope bonds.</p>
      <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Escape Artist, you get a +2
bonus on checks made to bind someone.</p>
