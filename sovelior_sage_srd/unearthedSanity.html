      This variant system allows you to introduce an element of dark horror into
      your d20 game. In campaigns using these rules, characters gain a new
      attribute called Sanity. This statistic functions like an ability score in
      some ways, but it has its own unique mechanics that represent the
      character�s descent from a stable and healthy mental state into confusion,
      dementia, and mental instability. As a character encounters monsters,
      witnesses horrible acts, masters forbidden knowledge, or casts spells, his
      Sanity score, and his corresponding ability to function as a normal member
      of his race, deteriorates. This gradual descent is balanced in part by the
      powers that characters gain each time they overcome a horrific foe or grow
      in skill and expertise, but even as those characters grow in power, they
      know or fear that an even greater peril lies ahead � the threat of becoming
      permanently insane.
    <h5><a id="behind-the-curtain-sanity"></a>
      BEHIND THE CURTAIN: SANITY
    </h5>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px">
      Because it affects the way that characters interact with the creatures and
      objects that they encounter on their adventures in many different and
      profound ways, this variant, perhaps more than any other in Unearthed
      Arcana, can alter the entire feel of a campaign. If you adopt this variant
      in your campaign, the largest change will most likely be one of tone (this
      applies to an even greater extent if you adopt the entire Cthulhu Mythos
      that the variant is based on).
    <p>
      As in the Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying Game, characters feel more
      vulnerable, for no matter how powerful they become, the dark gods are
      always greater. Religion is not only a source of comfort or succor, but
      also a dangerous enemy. (In those games that use the Cthulhu Mythos,
      religion seldom provides any succor at all.) Characters are suspicious,
      even paranoid, for a seemingly innocent commoner could secretly serve a
      cult. And yet, with such dark challenges come the opportunities for
      greater heroism.
    </p></div>
    <h5><a id="what-is-sanity"></a>
      WHAT IS SANITY?
    </h5>
      Sanity is the natural mental state of ordinary life. Normal mental balance
      is endangered when characters confront horrors, entities, or activities
      that are shocking, unnatural, and bewildering. Such encounters cause a
      character to lose points from his Sanity score, which in turn risks
      temporary, indefinite, or permanent insanity. Mental stability and lost
      Sanity points can be restored, up to a point, but psychological scars may
      remain.
    <p>
      Insanity occurs if too many Sanity points are lost in too short a time.
      Insanity does not necessarily occur if Sanity points are low, but a lower
      Sanity score makes some forms of insanity more likely to occur after a
      character experiences an emotional shock. The character�s Sanity may be
      regained after a few minutes, recovered after a few months, or lost
      forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character may regain Sanity points, and even increase her Sanity point
      maximum. However, increasing a character�s ranks in the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#knowledge-forbidden-lore">Knowledge
      (forbidden lore)</a> skill always lowers her maximum Sanity by an equal
      amount.
    </p>
    <h5><a id="forbidden-knowledge"></a>
      FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
    </h5>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px">
      The Sanity rules assume that some knowledge is so alien to human
      understanding that simply learning of its existence can shatter the
      psyche. While magic and nonhuman races form an everyday part of a d20
      character�s life, even a seasoned adventurer cannot conquer or understand
      some things. Knowledge of these secrets and creatures is represented by a
      new skill that goes hand in hand with a character�s Sanity score:
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#knowledge-forbidden-lore">Knowledge (forbidden lore)</a>.
    <p>
      This type of knowledge permanently erodes a character�s ability to
      maintain a stable and sane outlook, and a character�s current Sanity can
      never be higher than 99 minus the modifier the character has in the
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#knowledge-forbidden-lore">Knowledge (forbidden lore)</a> skill. This number (99 minus Knowledge
      [forbidden lore] ranks) is the character�s maximum Sanity.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="knowledge-forbidden-lore"></a>
      Knowledge (Forbidden Lore) (None)
    </h6>
      You know That Which Should Not Be Known. You have had horrible
      supernatural experiences and read forbidden tomes, learning truly dark
      secrets that have challenged everything you thought you knew. Since these
      revelations defy logic or commonly accepted fact, it does not matter how
      intelligent or wise you are when using this skill � only how much exposure
      to these dark secrets themselves you have experienced.
    <p><b>Check:</b> Answering a question about the horrible deities and secrets that lurk at
      the edges of reality has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for
      elementary questions), or 20 to 30 (for difficult or really tough
      questions). Unlike in other fields of study, there are almost no really
      easy questions associated with this dark knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or
      vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the
      monster�s HD. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful
      information about that monster. For every 5 points by which your check
      result exceeds the DC, the GM can give another piece of useful
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GM can decide which monsters are subject to the Knowledge (forbidden
      lore) skill and which monsters are subject to one of the standard
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> skills. For example, the GM may rule that Knowledge (the planes)
      is still the relevant skill for learning or knowing about outsiders,
      rather than allowing them to be identified by Knowledge (forbidden lore).
      However, in most campaigns that use the Sanity variant, aberrations and
      oozes should be able to be identified by Knowledge (forbidden lore) rather
      than by Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (dungeoneering) respectively.
    </p>
    <p><b>Action:</b> Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowledge check doesn�t take an
      action�you simply know the answer or you don�t.
    </p>
    <p><b>Try Again:</b> No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a
      second time doesn�t let you know something that you never learned in the
      first place.
    </p>
    <p><b>Special:</b>You cannot gain ranks in this skill by spending skill points. You can only
      gain ranks by reading forbidden tomes or having experiences with horrible
      creatures. Each rank you gain in this skill permanently reduces your
      maximum Sanity by 1 point: The more you know about the horrible truths
      underlying reality, the less capable you are of leading a normal life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character�s first episode of insanity (that is, an occurrence of
      temporary or indefinite insanity) bestows 2 ranks in the Knowledge
      (forbidden lore) skill, thereby lowering his maximum Sanity by 2 points.
      Each time a character fails a Sanity check and endures another episode of
      insanity, he gains an additional rank in Knowledge (forbidden lore).
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, Torin has 1 rank of Knowledge (forbidden lore) after
      reading a strange manuscript. She then steps outside, sees a chaos beast,
      and goes indefinitely insane, her raving mind failing to understand the
      strange creature she has encountered. Since she has never gone insane
      before, her player adds 2 ranks of Knowledge (forbidden lore) to Torin�s
      character sheet. Now Torin�s Maximum Sanity is 96 (99 minus 3 ranks of
      Knowledge [forbidden lore]).
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot take the Knowledge (forbidden lore) skill during character
      creation. However, the skill has no maximum rank; your level does not
      limit the number of ranks in Knowledge (forbidden lore) that you can
      acquire.
    </p></div>
    <h5><a id="sanity-points"></a>
      SANITY POINTS
    </h5>
      Sanity points measure the stability of a character�s mind. This attribute
      provides a way to define the sanity inherent in a character, the most
      stability a character can ever have, and the current level of sane
      rationality that a character preserves, even after numerous shocks and
      horrid revelations.
    <p>
      Sanity is measured in three ways: starting Sanity, current Sanity, and
      maximum Sanity. Starting and current Sanity cannot exceed maximum Sanity.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="starting-sanity"></a>
      Starting Sanity
    </h6>
      A character�s starting Sanity equals his Wisdom score multiplied by 5.
      This score represents a starting character�s current Sanity, as well as
      the upper limit of Sanity that can be restored by the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> skill (see <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#the-heal-skill-and-mental-treatment">The
      Heal Skill and Mental Treatment</a>, later in this section). After creation, a
      character�s current Sanity often fluctuates considerably and might never
      again match starting Sanity. A change in a character�s Wisdom score
      changes his starting Sanity in terms of what treatment with the Heal skill
      can restore. Current Sanity, however, does not change if Wisdom rises or
      falls.
    <h6><a id="current-sanity"></a>
      Current Sanity
    </h6>
      A character�s current Sanity score fluctuates almost as often as (and
      sometimes much more often than) his hit points.
    <p><b><a id="making-a-sanity-check"></a>Making a Sanity Check:</b>
      When a character encounters a gruesome, unnatural, or supernatural
      situation, the GM may require the player to make a Sanity check using
      percentile dice (d%). The check succeeds if the result is equal to or less
      than the character�s current Sanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a successful check, the character either loses no Sanity points or
      loses only a minimal amount. Potential Sanity loss is usually shown as two
      numbers or die rolls separated by a slash, such as 0/1d4. The number
      before the slash indicates the number of Sanity points lost if the Sanity
      check succeeds (in this case, none); the number after the slash indicates
      the number of Sanity points lost if the Sanity check fails (in this case,
      between 1 and 4 points).
    </p>
    <p>
      A character�s current Sanity is also at risk when the character reads
      certain books, learns certain types of spells, and attempts to cast them.
      These Sanity losses are usually automatic (no Sanity check is allowed);
      the character who chooses to undertake the activity forfeits the indicated
      number of Sanity points.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases, a new Sanity-shaking confrontation requires a new Sanity
      check. However, the GM always gets to decide when characters make Sanity
      checks. Confronting several horribly mangled corpses at one time or in
      rapid succession may call for just one Sanity check, while the same
      corpses encountered singly over the course of several game hours may
      require separate checks.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="going-insane"></a>Going Insane:</b>
      Losing more than a few Sanity points may cause a character to go insane,
      as described below. If a character�s Sanity score drops to 0 or lower, she
      begins the quick slide into permanent insanity. Each round, the character
      loses another point of Sanity. Once a character�s Sanity score reaches
      -10, she is hopelessly, incurably insane. The <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> skill can be used to
      stabilize a character on the threshold of permanent insanity; see <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#the-heal-skill-and-mental-treatment">The Heal
      Skill and Mental Treatment</a>, below, for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      A GM�s description of a Sanity-shaking situation should always justify the
      threat to a character�s well-being. Thus, a horde of frothing rats is
      horrifying, while a single ordinary rat usually is not (unless the
      character has an appropriate phobia, of course).
    </p>
    <h6><a id="maximum-sanity"></a>
      Maximum Sanity
    </h6>
      Ranks in the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#knowledge-forbidden-lore">Knowledge (forbidden lore)</a> skill simulate a character�s
      comprehension of aspects of the dark creatures at the edges of reality.
      Once gained, this horrible knowledge is never forgotten, and the character
      consequently surrenders mental equilibrium. A character�s Sanity weakens
      as his comprehension of these hidden truths increases. Such is the way of
      the universe.
    <p>
      A character�s current Sanity can never be higher than 99 minus the
      character�s ranks in the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#knowledge-forbidden-lore">Knowledge (forbidden lore)</a> skill. This number (99
      minus Knowledge [forbidden lore] ranks) is the character�s maximum Sanity.
    </p>
    <h5><a id="loss-of-sanity"></a>
      LOSS OF SANITY
    </h5>
      Characters ordinarily lose Sanity in a few types of circumstances: when
      encountering something unimaginable, when suffering a severe shock, after
      casting a spell or when learning a new spell, when being affected by a
      certain type of magic or a particular spell, or when reading a forbidden
      tome.
    <h6><a id="encountering-the-unimaginable"></a>
      Encountering the Unimaginable
    </h6>
      When people perceive creatures and entities of unspeakable horror, this
      experience costs them some portion of their minds, since such creatures
      are intrinsically discomforting and repellent. We never lose awareness of
      their slimy, fetid, alien nature. This instinctive reaction is part and
      parcel of humans, elves, dwarves, and other humanoid races. In this
      category, we can include supernatural events or agents not always
      recognized as specifically devoted to these dark gods, such as hauntings,
      zombies, vampires, curses, and so on.
    <p>
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-sanity-loss-from-creatures">Table: Sanity Loss from Creatures</a> provides some default Sanity loss values
      for encountering creatures, based on their type and size. These are only
      default values � the GM can and should adjust individual monsters he deems
      more or less horrible than others of their size. An <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersOtoR.html#planetouched">aasimar</a>, for instance,
      hardly presents a Sanity-shaking sight, and should probably be treated as
      a humanoid rather than an outsider. On the other hand, a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersTtoZ.html#vargouille">vargouille</a> � a
      Small outsider appearing much like a flying, bat-winged head � might provoke
      a much more visceral reaction than other Small outsiders.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, certain types of monstrous behavior might force additional
      Sanity checks, much like those described under Severe Shocks, below. For
      instance, an <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersA.html#aboleth">aboleth</a> is an
      unnerving sight, but watching one transform your best friend with it's
      slime should certainly force another check, with losses appropriate to the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most d20 games, no character should need to make a Sanity check when
      encountering an elf, dwarf, or other standard humanoid race, or for
      encountering domesticated or otherwise commonplace animals. In some cases,
      even humanoid races such as orcs and goblins might be so common as to not
      cause Sanity loss either.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="specific-monsters-and-sanity"></a>Specific Monsters and Sanity:</b>
      Some monsters have additional or variant special abilities when using the
      Sanity variant.
    </p>
    <p><i><a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersA.html#allip">Allip</a>:</i>
      The allip�s madness ability causes the loss of 2d6 Sanity points rather
      than the normal effect.
    </p>
    <p><i><a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersDtoDe.html#derro">Derro</a>:</i>
      The derro�s madness ability protects these creatures from any further
      Sanity loss. Sane derro (especially derro player characters) track Sanity
      points normally.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="monstrous-characters-and-sanity"></a>Monstrous Characters and Sanity:</b>
      In most cases, the GM does not need to keep track of a monster�s Sanity
      score, but sometimes, especially when in the hands of a player, monsters
      need Sanity scores just as other characters do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although most campaigns that use the Sanity variant limit players to
      creating characters from the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="races.html">standard player
      character races</a>, it�s still easy to envision a world where one or two
      monstrous races are so common or so integrated into the culture of other
      races that the GM wants to present them as viable player character
      options. In these cases, the monsters available as player character races
      should never provoke a Sanity loss from other characters or NPCs, and
      these creatures should have a Sanity score and track their Sanity losses
      just like characters made with the standard PC races. A monster should
      never lose Sanity for seeing others of its race (<a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersS.html#spectre">spectres</a> don�t lose
      Sanity when encountering other spectres, and so on). In all cases, what
      causes Sanity loss for a specific creature is in the hands of the GM.

      Severe Shocks
    </h6>
      A shocking sight of a more mundane nature can also cost Sanity points.
      Severe shocks include witnessing an untimely or violent death,
      experiencing personal mutilation, losing social position, being the victim
      of treachery, or whatever else the GM decides is sufficiently
      extreme. The following list gives some examples of severe shocks, and the
      Sanity loss each one provokes.

      Casting Spells
    </h6>
      Magic relies on the physics of the true universe. By casting spells,
      characters visualize the unimaginable, warping their minds to follow alien
      ways of thought. These visualizations wound the mind. Although
      spellcasters expose themselves to such traumas voluntarily, they are
      shocks all the same.
    <p>
      In this variant, casting a spell drains a certain amount of Sanity. This
      rule represents the fact that spellcasting forces the mind into strange
      patterns and thought processes with which it is poorly equipped to deal.
      The GM can choose from the three options presented in the table below,
      deducting a low, moderate, or extreme number of Sanity points from a
      character who casts a spell. In a campaign featuring low Sanity loss, a
      spellcaster is rarely penalized for casting a spell, especially if the GM
      also chooses to give characters <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#sanity-resistance">Sanity resistance</a> in
      such cases. In a campaign featuring moderate Sanity loss, spellcasters
      face a slightly higher risk of insanity than members of other classes,
      even if they have Sanity resistance. When using this option, players
      should, for the most part, choose spellcasting levels only as multiclass
      options. In a campaign featuring extreme Sanity loss, spellcasters have a
      difficult time participating in adventures regularly because they find it
      hard to use their classes� primary abilities without soon going insane.

      In addition to the guidelines presented for each campaign option above,
      the GM is free to impose additional modifiers on the Sanity loss caused by
      spells of a certain type, a certain school, or even individual spells.
      Here are some example conditions that a GM could choose to incorporate
      into a game.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Abjurations cost 1 less Sanity point to cast.
      </li>
      <li>Divine spells cost 5 additional Sanity points to cast.
      </li>
      <li>Druids suffer only half the Sanity loss from spellcasting (round
      fractions up).
      </li>
      <li>Healing spells drain no Sanity when cast.
      </li>
      <li>The invisibility spell, and any variation thereof, costs 1 additional
      Sanity Point to cast.
      </li>
      <li>Necromancy spells cost 2 additional Sanity points to cast.
      </li>
      <li>Spellcasters of some classes follow the guidelines of one campaign
      option, while spellcasters of other classes follow the guidelines of
      another campaign option.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h6><a id="learning-spells"></a>
      Learning Spells
    </h6>
      Learning spells, like casting them, exposes a character to unknowable
      secrets and can damage and warp the mind. In this variant, whenever a
      spellcaster learns a new spell, he loses Sanity points. In most cases, the
      Sanity loss is equal to the spell�s level, but if the spell is included in
      a tome of forbidden knowledge (see below), the loss can be greater.
    <p>
      The rules for Sanity loss for learning spells work fine for wizards,
      sorcerers, and other arcane spellcasting classes that learn spells one at
      a time or in small groups, but this loss can easily overwhelm a cleric,
      druid, or other divine spellcaster who gains a new spellcasting level
      (thereby �learning� an entire level�s worth of new spells all at once). In
      such a case, the player and the GM should work together to determine a
      specific number of spells learned once access to a new spellcasting level
      is gained. When in doubt about how many spells to allow a spellcaster to
      learn at any given level, the spell acquisition rate of the wizard class
      serves as a good baseline.
    </p>
    <p>
      GMs wanting to add Sanity rules to a magic-rich campaign, or those wishing
      to preserve more of the flavor of a normal d20 game, can allow any
      spellcaster to learn a small number of spells at each level without losing
      any Sanity.

      In this variant, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#remove-fear">remove fear</a> does not automatically suppress an existing
      fear effect on its subjects, but if it is cast on a creature that lost
      Sanity because of a fear effect within the last 24 hours, that Sanity loss
      is halved (to a minimum of 1 point) and the creature�s current Sanity is
      adjusted accordingly.
    </p>

    <p><b><a id="illusions"></a>Illusions:</b>
      Illusions, when they are believed, cause Sanity loss just as if the real
      horrific monster or event were present. The GM can reduce the Sanity loss
      caused by illusions (or eliminate it entirely) if such spells appear
      frequently in the campaign.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="bestow-curse"></a>Bestow Curse:</b>
      When using the Sanity variant, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsAtoB.html#bestow-curse">this spell</a> can cause a Sanity check rather
      than a Will save. If the victim fails the Sanity check, he loses 3d6
      points of Sanity. Unlike normal Sanity loss, this number is also
      subtracted from the character�s maximum Sanity. Magic that removes the
      curse (such as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#remove-curse">remove curse</a> or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsAtoB.html#break-enchantment">break enchantment</a>) can restore the
      character�s normal maximum Sanity, but separate magic or the use of the
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> skill is required to restore the character�s current Sanity.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="contact-other-plane"></a>Contact Other Plane:</b>
      When using the Sanity variant, characters casting <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsC.html#contact-other-plane">this spell</a> risk a lost
      of Sanity instead of Intelligence and Charisma. Whenever a character casts
      this spell, she must make a Sanity check. If the check fails, the
      character loses Sanity depending on the plane that the character was
      trying to contact, according to the table below. Unlike the Intelligence
      and Charisma reduction caused by the normal version of this spell, the
      Sanity loss does not go away after a week � the loss is permanent until
      restored by another spell or through the use of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> skill.</p>

      Reading Forbidden Tomes
    </h6>
      Obscure tomes add ranks to a character�s <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#knowledge-forbidden-lore">Knowledge (forbidden lore)</a> skill
      and teach arcane spells. Studying and comprehending these books causes all
      that we know to become like shadows. The burning power of a greater
      reality seizes the soul. Whether we try to retreat from the experience or
      hunger greedily for more, it destroys our confidence in what we once
      believed, opening us up to the all-encompassing truths of dark deities.
    <p>
      For each such book encountered, the GM must set the examination period,
      the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#knowledge">Knowledge</a> (arcana) DC to understand it, the number of spells contained
      in it, the Sanity loss that occurs upon beginning the examination, the
      Sanity loss that occurs upon completion of the examination, and the ranks
      of <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#knowledge-forbidden-lore">Knowledge (forbidden lore)</a> gained from studying the book. While the GM

    <h5><a id="sanity-resistance"></a>
      SANITY RESISTANCE
    </h5>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px">The Sanity mechanic was originally created to mimic the effect that the
      unspeakable horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos would have on normal folk from a
      world much like our own. Since d20 characters live in a world of magic and
      monsters, however, the GM might want to make them less susceptible to
      Sanity loss caused by encountering strange creatures (see <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-sanity-loss-from-creatures">Table: Sanity
      Loss from Creatures</a>) by allowing them to have a measure of Sanity
      resistance, which is tied to one of two attributes.
    <p>
      Each character can be allowed to have Sanity resistance equal to his
      character level. Alternatively, each character can be allowed to have
      Sanity resistance equal to his Wisdom modifier. (Obviously, the second
      alternative will produce lower Sanity resistance figures in most cases.)
      This number is the amount of Sanity loss a character can ignore when he
      encounters a creature that requires a Sanity check.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GM may decide that Sanity resistance also applies to certain kinds of
      severe shocks (although it might not apply to personally horrific
      experiences, such as seeing a close friend die) and to the casting or
      learning of spells.
    </p></div>
    <h5><a id="getting-used-to-awfulness"></a>
      GETTING USED TO AWFULNESS
    </h5>
      Never underestimate the ability of the sentient mind to adapt, even to the
      most horrific experiences. Reading and rereading the same bit of
      disturbing text or seeing the same horrible image over and over eventually
      provokes no further loss of Sanity. Within a reasonable interval of play,
      usually a single session of the game, characters should not lose more
      Sanity points for seeing monsters of a particular sort than the maximum
      possible points a character could lose from seeing one such monster. For
      instance, the Sanity loss for seeing a single human <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersTtoZ.html#zombie">zombie</a> is 1/1d6. Thus,
      in the same game day or in the same play session, no character should lose
      more than 6 Sanity points for seeing any number of zombies. Keep in mind
      that the interpretation of �reasonable interval� must vary by GM and
      situation. When it feels right, the GM should rule that the horror is
      renewed and points must be lost again.
    <p>
      Learning or casting spells never becomes a normal occurrence. No matter
      how many times a character casts a spell, no matter what the time interval
      between castings may be, the Sanity loss is always the same. This point is
      also true for anything that a character does willingly. For example, if
      brutally murdering a friend costs 2/1d10 Sanity, this loss is incurred
      each time, even if the character loses the maximum possible points (10)
      after the first such murder he commits.
    </p>
    <h5><a id="types-of-insanity"></a>
      TYPES OF INSANITY
    </h5>
      Character insanity is induced by a swift succession of shocking
      experiences or ghastly revelations, events usually connected with dark
      gods, creatures from the Outer Planes, or powerful spellcasting.
    <p>
      Horrifying encounters can result in one of three states of mental
      unbalance: temporary, indefinite, and permanent insanity. The first two,
      temporary insanity and indefinite insanity, can be cured. The third,
      permanent insanity, results when a character�s Sanity points are reduced
      to -10 or lower. This condition cannot be cured.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="temporary-insanity"></a>
      Temporary Insanity
    </h6>
      Whenever a character loses Sanity points equal to one-half her Wisdom
      score from a single episode of Sanity loss, she has experienced enough of
      a shock that the GM must ask for a Sanity check. If the check fails, the
      character realizes the full significance of what she saw or experienced
      and goes temporarily insane. If the check succeeds, the character does not
      go insane, but she may not clearly remember what she experienced (a trick
      the mind plays to protect itself).
    <p>
      Temporary insanity might last for a few minutes or a few days. Perhaps the
      character acquires a phobia or fetish befitting the situation, faints,
      becomes hysterical, or suffers nervous twitches, but she can still respond
      rationally enough to run away or hide from a threat.

    <p>
      A character suffering from temporary insanity remains in this state for
      either a number of rounds or a number of hours; roll d% and consult <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-duration-of-temporary-insanity">Table:
      Duration of Temporary Insanity</a> to see whether the insanity is
      short-term or long-term. After determining the duration of the insanity,
      roll d% and consult either <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-short-term-temporary-insanity-effects">Table: Short-Term Temporary Insanity Effects</a>
      or <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-long-term-temporary-insanity-effects">Table: Long-Term Temporary Insanity Effects</a> to identify the specific
      effect of the insanity. The GM must describe the effect so that the player
      can roleplay it accordingly. Ideas for phobias and episodes of insanity
      are described later in this chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Successful application of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> skill (see <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#the-heal-skill-and-mental-treatment">The Heal Skill and Mental
      Treatment</a>, below) may alleviate or erase temporary insanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temporary insanity ends either when the duration rolled on <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-duration-of-temporary-insanity">Table: Duration of Temporary Insanity</a> has
      elapsed, or earlier if the GM considers it appropriate to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an episode of temporary insanity ends, traces or even profound
      evidence of the experience should remain. No reason exists why, for
      instance, a phobia should depart from someone�s mind as quickly as a
      warrior draws his sword. What remains behind after a brief episode of
      temporary insanity should exert a pervasive influence on the character.
      The character may still be a bit batty, but her conscious mind once again
      runs the show.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a variant rule, if the amount of Sanity lost exceeds the character�s
      current Wisdom score, consider the temporary insanity to always be of the
      long-term variety.

      Indefinite Insanity
    </h6>
    <p>
      If a character loses 20% (one-fifth) or more of her current Sanity points
      in the space of 1 hour, she goes indefinitely insane. The GM judges when
      the impact of events calls for such a measure. Some GMs never apply the
      concept to more than the result of a single roll, since this state can
      remove characters from play for extended periods. An episode of indefinite
      insanity lasts for 1d6 game months (or as the GM dictates). Symptoms of
      indefinite insanity may not be immediately apparent (which may give the GM
      additional time to decide what the effects of such a bout of insanity
      might be).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-random-indefinite-insanity">Table: Random Indefinite Insanity</a> is provided as an aid to selecting
      what form a character�s indefinite insanity takes. (The mental disorders
      mentioned on this table are explained later in this section.) Many GMs
      prefer to choose an appropriate way for the insanity to manifest, based on
      the circumstances that provoked it. It�s also a good idea to consult with
      the player of the afflicted character to see what sort of mental malady
      the player wishes to roleplay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of indefinite insanity is encompassing and incapacitating. For
      instance, a schizophrenic may be able to walk the streets while babbling
      and gesticulating, find rudimentary shelter, and beg for enough food to
      survive, but most of the business of the mind has departed into itself:
      She cannot fully interact with friends, family, and acquaintances.
      Conversation, cooperation, and all sense of personal regard have vanished
      from her psyche.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible for characters with indefinite insanity to continue to be
      played as active characters, depending on the form their madness takes.
      The character may still attempt to stumble madly through the rest of an
      adventure. However, with her weakened grasp on reality, she is most likely
      a danger to herself and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a general rule, a character suffering from indefinite insanity should
      be removed from active play until she recovers. At the GM�s discretion,
      the player of the character might be allowed to use a temporary character
      until the end of the story. Whether this �stand-in� character is an
      incidental NPC in the adventure, a character of the same level as the rest
      of the group, one or two levels below the rest of the characters, or even
      a 1st-level character, is up to the GM. Different GMs have different ways
      of handling this transition.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character goes indefinitely insane near the end of an adventure, the
      GM may decide to set the next adventure to begin after the insane
      character has recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters suffering from indefinite insanity are in limbo, unable to help
      themselves or others. The <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> skill can be used to restore Sanity points
      during this period, but the underlying insanity remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      After recovery, a victim retains definite traces of madness. For example,
      even though a character knows he is no longer insane, she might be deathly
      afraid of going to sleep if her insanity manifested itself in the form of
      terrifying nightmares. The character is in control of her actions, but the
      experience of insanity has changed her, perhaps forever.

      Permanent Insanity
    </h6>
      A character whose Sanity score falls to -10 goes permanently insane. The
      character becomes an NPC under the control of the GM.
    <p>
      A character with permanent insanity may be reduced to a raving lunatic or
      may be outwardly indistinguishable from a normal person; either way, she
      is inwardly corrupted by the pursuit of knowledge and power. Some of the
      most dangerous cultists in the world are characters who have become
      permanently insane, been corrupted by forbidden knowledge, and �gone over
      to the other side.�
    </p>
    <p>
      A character might be driven permanently insane by forces other than dark
      gods or forbidden knowledge. In such cases, moral corruption need not
      necessarily occur. The GM might decide to consider different sorts of
      permanent insanity, rolling randomly or choosing from among the mental

    <p>
      A character who has gone permanently insane can never be normal again (in
      some campaigns, a permanently insane character can be cured with the aid
      of powerful magic). She is forever lost in her own world. This need not
      mean a lifetime locked away from society, merely that the character has
      retreated so far from reality that normal mental functions can never be
      restored. She might be able to lead, within restricted bounds, a more or
      less normal life if kept away from the stimulus that triggers strong
      responses in her individual case. Yet a relapse may come quickly. Her calm
      facade can be destroyed in seconds if even the smallest reminder of what
      it was that drove her mad disturbs her fragile equilibrium. In any event,
      the eventual fate of a permanently insane character is a matter for
      individual GM and players to decide.

    <h5><a id="variant-rule-insane-insight"></a>
      VARIANT RULE: INSANE INSIGHT
    </h5>
      At the GM�s option, a character who has just gone insane may have an
      insight into the situation or entity that provoked the insanity. The
      player needs to make a DC 15 Wisdom check to gain the insight. Information
      provided by this sudden burst of awareness is up to the GM, but it may
      include something about a creature�s origin or a fact about its nature
      (feeding habits, natural habitat, weakness), a clue to the identity of a
      murderer at a murder scene, or some hint at a location of great
      importance.
    <h5><a id="gaining-or-recovering-sanity"></a>
      GAINING OR RECOVERING SANITY
    </h5>
      A character�s Sanity score can increase during the events of a campaign.
      Although a character�s Sanity score can never exceed 99 minus her
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#knowledge-forbidden-lore">Knowledge (forbidden lore)</a> ranks, her maximum Sanity and current Sanity
      can exceed her starting Sanity.
    <p><b><a id="level-advancement"></a>Level Advancement:</b>
      A character�s current Sanity can become higher than her starting Sanity as
      a result of gained levels: Whenever a character gains a new level, she
      rolls 1d6 and adds the result to her current Sanity. Some GMs may feel
      such self-improvement to be antithetical to this variant�s dark tone, and
      thus may not allow it. Others may allow it if the player can roll over her
      character�s current Sanity points after the character gains a level. Most
      Game Masters should find the question to be of no consequence, since
      characters continue to go insane regardless of how many Sanity points they
      gain. This is a point for players to be aware of, but not to worry about.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="sotry-awards"></a>Story Awards:</b>
      The GM may decide to award increases in character�s current Sanity if they
      foil a great horror, a demonic plan, or some other nefarious enterprise.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="mental-therapy"></a>
      Mental Therapy
    </h6>
      To give useful mental therapy, a therapist must have the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> skill.
      Intensive treatment can return Sanity points to a troubled character.
      However, Sanity points restored in this manner can never cause the
      patient�s Sanity score to exceed her starting Sanity or maximum Sanity,
      whichever is lower. A character can have only one healer at a time. See
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#the-heal-skill-and-mental-treatment">The Heal Skill and Mental Treatment</a> sidebar for a detailed description of
      how this works.
    <p>
      Such treatment can also be used to help a character snap out of an episode
      of <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#temporary-insanity">temporary insanity</a> (for example, from an acute panic attack). It does
      not speed recovery from indefinite insanity, but it can strengthen a
      character by increasing her Sanity points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovery from <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#indefinite-insanity">indefinite insanity</a> only comes with time (typically, 1d6
      months). It is not dependent upon the character�s Sanity points and is not
      connected to them. A character can be sane with 24 Sanity points and
      insane while possessing 77 Sanity points.
    </p>
        <h6><a id="the-heal-skill-and-mental-treatment"></a>
      The Heal Skill And Mental Treatment
    </h6>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px">The Sanity rules presented here provide a new use for the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> skill,
      allowing trained healers to help characters recover lost Sanity points.
      The DC and effect of a Heal check made to restore lost Sanity depend on
      whether the therapist is trying to offer immediate care or long-term care.
    <p><i><a id="immediate-care"></a>Immediate Care:</i>
      When someone suffers an episode of <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#temporary-insanity">temporary insanity</a>, a therapist can
      bring him out of it � calming his terror, snapping him out of his stupor, or
      doing whatever else is needed to restore the patient to the state she was
      in before the temporary insanity � by making a DC 15 <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> check as a
      full-round action.
    </p>
    <p>
      A therapist can also use immediate care to stabilize the Sanity score of a
      character whose current Sanity is between -1 and -9. On a successful DC 15
      check (requiring a full-round action), the character�s Sanity score
      improves to 0.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="long-term-care"></a>Long-Term Care:</i>
      Providing long-term care means treating a mentally disturbed person for a
      day or more in a place away from stress and distractions. A therapist must
      spend 1d4 hours per day doing nothing but talking to the patient. If the
      therapist makes a DC 20 <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> check at the end of this time, the patient
      recovers 1 Sanity point. A therapist can tend up to six patients at a
      time; each patient beyond the first adds 1 hour to the total time per day
      that must be devoted to therapy. The check must be made each day for each
      patient. A roll of 1 on any of these Heal checks indicates that the
      patient loses 1 point of Sanity that day, as she regresses mentally due to
      horrors suddenly remembered.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="variant-knowledge-mental-therapy"></a>Variant�Knowledge (Mental Therapy):</b>
      A new skill called Knowledge (mental therapy) can serve as the primary way
      to treat those who have suffered Sanity loss. Knowledge (mental therapy)
      is a Wisdom-based skill that cannot be used untrained. If you use this
      variant, characters with the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> skill can only offer immediate care, and
      cannot offer long-term care. The Knowledge (mental therapy) skill allows
      both types of treatment.
    </p>
    <p><i>Note:</i>
      If magical means of restoring Sanity are present in the campaign, the
      Knowledge (mental therapy) skill is generally not worth including as a
      separate skill, because characters are better off simply using magic
      rather than devoting precious skill points to such a narrow-focus skill.
      If magic cannot restore Sanity, the ability to restore Sanity by other
      means is much more important, and Knowledge (mental therapy) should
      probably exist as a separate skill.
    </p></div>
    <h6><a id="restoring-sanity-with-magic"></a>
      Restoring Sanity with Magic
    </h6>
      The way that Sanity loss and magic healing interact can greatly affect the
      feel of your game. At one extreme, the GM can rule that magic can easily
      cure Sanity loss, in which case Sanity becomes little more than a
      specialized version of �mental hit points� that includes some neat side
      effects (insanity). In such a case, characters can usually restore
      themselves to full Sanity with a day or two of rest and spellcasting.
    <p>
      At the other extreme, the campaign might be structured so that magical
      healing can do little or nothing to restore Sanity, and even powerful
      divine spellcasters capable of curing the most deadly physical malady shy
      away from those encounters that might drain away Sanity points. The spells
      that can potentially restore Sanity points are discussed below. The GM
      should feel free to choose which of these spell effects are present in the
      game, but once established, these effects should not be changed in
      mid-campaign.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="atonement"></a>Atonement:</b>
      Although <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsAtoB.html#atonement">this spell</a> does not usually restore Sanity, it can be used in
      those rare cases when a character�s own actions inadvertently lead to an
      evil act that causes the character to lose Sanity points. If a quest or
      geas is combined with the atonement spell, Sanity points are not restored
      until the task is completed. A successful use of the atonement spell can
      restore all Sanity lost through the direct result of the evil acts for
      which the character atones.

    <h6><a id="alchemical-treatments"></a>
      Alchemical Treatments
    </h6>
      In the real world, psychiatric drugs play a key role in the modern
      treatment of many mental disorders. Although psychiatric drugs were
      administered to patients in the early part of the 20th century, only in
      the 1940s and later were they broadly and consistently effective in
      treating the symptoms of emotional trauma.
    <p>
      In a fantasy game, the GM should decide whether rare herbs and alchemical
      substances can provide the same benefits that modern psychiatric drugs can
      deliver. It is quite believable, for example, that a group of wizards discovered alchemical means of
      isolating substances that affect the mind in profound ways, offering many
      of the same benefits of modern medicine. Therefore, the GM need only
      decide how easily he wants characters to overcome Sanity loss and insanity
      effects. Once the desired tone of the campaign is known, the GM can
      determine whether alchemical treatment is available. The Sanity variant
      assumes that skilled alchemists can create substances that offer the same
      benefits that psychiatric drugs can provide.
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as a character can afford the correct herbs and alchemical
      substances and is able to ingest them, the symptoms of indefinite insanity
      can be ignored. Ingesting these alchemical substances and drugs does not
      make a character immune or even particularly resistant to further Sanity
      losses. A DC 25 <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) check is needed to accurately prepare the
      correct herbs and substances and administer the correct dosage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long-term alchemical treatment can restore lost Sanity points, just as use
      of the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> skill can. For each month the character takes an accurately
      prescribed psychiatric medication, she regains 1d3 Sanity points. As with
      treatment through the Heal skill, long-term drug therapy can never raise a
      character�s current Sanity above her starting Sanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character cannot regain Sanity from both treatment with the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> skill
      and alchemical treatment in the same month.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="drugs-and-sanity"></a>
      Drugs and Sanity
    </h6>
      Drugs in the d20 game follow many of the same rules as poisons, allowing
      the imbiber saving throws to resist their initial and secondary effects.
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsDtoE.html#delay-poison">Delay poison</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsMtoO.html#neutralize-poison">neutralize poison</a>, and similar effects negate or end a
      drug�s effects, but they do not restore hit points, ability damage, or
      other damage caused by the substance.
    <p>
      A creature that willingly takes a drug automatically fails both saving
      throws. It is not possible to intentionally fail the initial save but
      attempt to save against the secondary effect, or vice versa. Save DCs are
      provided for situations in which a character is unwillingly drugged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drugs also have some uses in treating insanity. The drugs described below
      all affect a character�s Sanity to some extent.
    </p>

      Drug Addiction
    </h6>
      Drug addiction functions much like <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#disease">diseases</a>. The
      characteristics of certain forms of addiction are summarized on the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#table-addictions">table
      below</a>. Upon initial exposure (any time a character imbibes or applies a
      drug with an addiction rating), the character must succeed on a Fortitude
      save or become addicted. Instead of having an incubation period as a
      disease does, a drug has a satiation period, which is the length of time a
      single dose remains effective in a character�s system. Addiction, if not
      satisfied by further doses of the drug, proceeds like a disease � the
      character takes <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#ability-damaged">ability damage</a> each day unless he succeeds on a Fortitude
      save.

    <p><b><a id="addiction-rating"></a>Addiction Rating:</b>
      Each drug is rated according to its addictive potential, from lowest
      (negligible) to highest (extreme). Sometimes, an individual�s long-term
      addiction raises a drug�s addiction rating for that individual. Drugs with
      a negligible rating are not subject to this change. Stronger drugs
      increase their addiction rating by one step for every two full months a
      character remains addicted to the drug. A character who recovers from an
      addiction and later becomes addicted again to the same drug does so at the
      addiction rating the drug had just prior to his earlier recovery.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="satiation"></a>Satiation:</b>
      Each time a user takes a drug to which he is addicted, he is satiated and
      staves off withdrawal symptoms for the period of time indicated on the
      table. Whenever the satiation period expires before the user takes another
      dose, the DC of the Fortitude save to resist damage (see below) increases
      by 5. The dose that causes a character to becomes addicted counts for the
      purpose of tracking the satiation period.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="drug-damage"></a>Damage:</b>
      An addicted user who is not satiated takes the indicated amount of ability
      damage each day unless the character succeeds on a Fortitude saving throw.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="recovery"></a>Recovery:</b>
      If a character makes two successful saving throws in a row, he has fought
      off his addiction and recovered, and takes no more damage from withdrawal
      symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>

      ability damage caused by an addiction, but the next day the victim may
      take more ability damage if he continues to fail his Fortitude saves.
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="spellsPtoR.html#remove-disease">Remove disease</a> immediately causes a user to recover from an addiction, but

      recovery and restores all ability damage from the addiction.
    </p>
    <h5><a id="treatment-of-insanity"></a>
      TREATMENT OF INSANITY
    </h5>
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#teporary-insanity">Temporary insanity</a> ends so quickly that schedules of treatment are
      essentially pointless; it runs its course soon enough that one merely need
      protect a deranged character from further upset or harm. On the other
      hand, treatment of <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#permanent-insanity">permanent insanity</a> has no real meaning. By definition,
      a permanently insane character never recovers, no matter how good the
      therapist or the facility. Thus, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#indefinite-insanity">indefinite insanity</a> is the only form of
      mental illness that might be addressed by intervention and treatment.
    <p>
      After 1d6 months, if undisturbed by further trauma and with the agreement
      of the Game Master, an indefinitely insane character finds enough mental
      balance to reenter the world. Three kinds of nonmagical care may help the
      character regain Sanity points during this recovery period. When choosing
      among them, the GM and player should consider the character�s resources,
      her friends and relatives, and how wisely she has behaved in the past. In
      most campaigns, the magical treatments described above (see <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#restoring-sanity-with-magic">Restoring
      Sanity with Magic</a>) allow the character to reenter play after a shorter
      time or with less expense.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="private-care"></a>
      Private Care
    </h6>
      The best care available is at home or in some friendly place (perhaps a
      small church or the home of a wealthy friend) where nursing can be tender,
      considerate, and undistracted by the needs of competing patients.
    <p>
      If mental healing or alchemical medications are available, roll d% for
      each game month that one or the other is used. A result of 01-95 is a
      success: Add 1d3 Sanity points for either mental therapy or alchemical
      medications, whichever is used (a character cannot benefit from both in
      the same month). On a result of 96-100, the healer fumbles the diagnosis
      or the character rejects the alchemical treatments. She loses 1d6 Sanity
      points, and no progress is made that month.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="institutionalization"></a>
      Institutionalization
    </h6>
      The next best alternative to private care is commitment to a good insane
      asylum, but these are extremely rare in most d20 campaigns, if they are
      present at all. GMs are free to rule that institutionalization is simply
      not available.
    <p>
      In those campaigns that include such institutions (usually located within
      the bounds of a temple devoted to a deity of healing), asylums may be said
      to have an advantage over home care in that they are relatively cheap or
      even a free service provided by a government or a powerful church. These
      institutions are of uneven quality, however, and some may be potentially
      harmful. Some are creative places of experiment and magic-assisted
      therapy, while others offer mere confinement. In any setting, concentrated
      and nourishing treatment by strangers is rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therapy using the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> skill is usually the only treatment available, but
      in most cases, primitive institutions offer no treatment at all. Sometimes
      an institution can convey an uncaring sense that undermines the useful
      effects of alchemical medications, leaving the character with a sense of
      anger and loss. He is likely to be distrustful of the organization and its
      motives. Escape attempts are common by inmates, even in the most
      enlightened fantasy settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roll d% for each game month a character is in the care of an institution.
      A result of 01-95 is a success; add 1d3 Sanity points if therapy with the
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> skill was available, or 1 Sanity point if no treatment was present.
      On a result of 96-100, the character rebels against the environment. He
      loses 1d6 Sanity points, and no progress can be made that month.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="wandering-and-homeless"></a>
      Wandering and Homeless
    </h6>
      If no care is available, an insane character may become a wandering
      derelict struggling for survival. Such a wanderer gains no Sanity points
      unless he is able to join a group of the homeless and find at least one
      friend among them. To find a friend after joining such a group, the
      character can make a DC 15 Charisma check once per month. If a friend
      appears, the character recovers 1 Sanity point per game month thereafter.
    <p>
      For each game month during which an insane character lives as a derelict,
      roll d%. On a result of 01-95, the character survives. On a result of
      96-100, the character dies as the result of disease, exposure, or
      violence.
    </p>
    <h5><a id="mental-disorders"></a>
      MENTAL DISORDERS
    </h5>
      The GM should choose how characters in the campaign world think and
      therefore talk about insanity before play begins. In many fantasy games,
      the term �insane� serves as an all-encompassing term that represents
      everything an inhabitant knows or understands about the full spectrum of
      mental disorders. In others, different forms of insanity may be identified
      for what they are.
    <p>
      This section offers descriptions of many specific mental disorders. Where
      appropriate, suggested modifiers to characters� attack rolls, saves, and
      checks are also given.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="anxiety-disorders"></a>
      Anxiety Disorders
    </h6>
      Even a seasoned adventurer feels anxious before braving a dragon�s cave,
      and the farmers in the village might worry that their crops will not
      survive until harvest. These fears are a normal, natural part of living in
      a danger-filled environment such as a d20 campaign setting, but in some
      cases these anxieties overwhelm an individual, causing inactivity,
      distress, and even severe behavioral problems. When fear and anxiety
      overwhelm a character for a prolonged period of time, the character
      suffers from an anxiety disorder. The most common forms of anxiety
      disorders are described below.
    <p><b><a id="generalized-anxiety-disorder"></a>Generalized Anxiety Disorder:</b>
      The character suffers from a variety of physical and emotional symptoms
      that can be grouped into certain categories.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="motor-tension"></a>Motor Tension:</i>
      Jitteriness, aches, twitches, restlessness, easily startled, easily
      <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#fatigued">fatigued</a>, and so on. All attack rolls, Fortitude and Reflex saves, and all
      checks involving Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution take a -2 penalty.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="autonomic-hyperactivity"></a>Autonomic Hyperactivity:</i>
      Sweating, racing heart, dizziness, clammy hands, flushed or pallid face,
      rapid pulse and respiration even when at rest, and so on. All attack
      rolls, saves, and checks take a -2 penalty.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="expectations-of-doom"></a>Expectations of Doom</i>
      Anxieties, worries, fears, and especially anticipations of misfortune. All
      attack rolls, saves, and checks take a -2 morale penalty.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="vigilance"></a>Vigilance:</i>
      Distraction, inability to focus, insomnia, irritability, impatience. All
      Will saves and checks involving Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma take a
      -4 morale penalty.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="panic-disorder-panic-attack"></a>Panic Disorder (Panic Attack):</b>
      This illness is marked by a discrete period of fear in which symptoms
      develop rapidly. Within minutes palpitation, sweating, trembling, and
      difficulty in breathing develop, strong enough that the victim fears
      immediate death or insanity. Burdened with the recurrence of these
      episodes, she fears their return. This reaction often leads to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#agoraphobia">agoraphobia</a>
      (see below).
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="agoraphobia-fear-of-open-places"></a><a id="agoraphobia"></a>Agoraphobia (Fear of Open Places):</b>
      The character becomes very nervous outside familiar surroundings and must
      make a DC 15 Will save in order to leave home or engage socially. May be
      linked to <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#panic-disorder-panic-attack">panic disorder</a> (see above) or to a related <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#phobia">phobia</a> (see below),
      such as uranophobia (fear of the sky), baraphobia (fear of loss of
      gravity), or xenophobia (fear of strangers).
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="obsessive-compulsive-disorder"></a>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder:</b>
      This illness manifests in one of two main forms, obsessive thoughts or
      compulsive actions; some characters exhibit both.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="obsessions"></a>Obsessions:</i>
      The character cannot help thinking about an idea, image, or impulse
      incessantly, often involving violence and self-doubt. These ideas are
      frequently repugnant to the character, but they are so strong that during
      times of stress she may be unable to concentrate on anything else, even if
      doing so is necessary for her survival. Obsessive impulses can be very
      dangerous when combined with auditory hallucinations, since the �voices�
      may urge the character to take some dangerous or hostile course of action.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="compulsions"></a>Compulsions:</i>
      The character insists on performing ritual actions, such as touching a
      doorway at left, right, and top before passing through it. Though she may
      agree that the actions are senseless, the need to perform them is
      overpowering and may last for 1d10 rounds. Even in times of great stress,
      the character may ignore her survival in order to perform the actions.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="post-traumatic-stress-disorder"></a>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder:</b>
      After a traumatic event, perhaps even years later, the character begins to
      relive the trauma through persistent thoughts, dreams, and flashbacks.
      Correspondingly, the character loses interest in daily activities. She may
      return to normal once the memories have been thoroughly explored and
      understood, but that process may take years.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="phobia-or-mania"></a>Phobia or Mania:</b>
      A character afflicted by a phobia or a mania persistently fears a
      particular object or situation. She realizes that the fear is excessive
      and irrational, but the fear is disturbing enough that she avoids the
      stimulus.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="phobia"></a>Phobia:</i>
      <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/UnA_Gallery/79181.jpg"><img
 class="art-wide" src="pict.jpg" title="" alt="pict"
 style="border: 0px solid ; width: 73px; height: 75px;" /></a>A DC 15 Will check is required for a character to be able to force herself
      into (or remain within) the presence of the object of her phobia, and even
      then the character takes a -2 morale penalty as long as the object of fear
      remains. In severe cases, the object of the phobia is imagined to be
      omnipresent, perhaps hidden � thus, someone with severe acrophobia (fear of
      heights) might be frightened when in an enclosed room on the upper story
      of a building, even if there were no window or other way to see how high
      up the room was. As many phobias exist as one cares to notice or name � the
      lists provided below cover merely some of the more common phobias that
      might affect d20 characters.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="mania"></a>Mania:</i>
      Manias are rarer than phobias. A character affected by a mania is
      inordinately fond of a particular stimulus and takes great pains to be
      with it or near it. When the character�s sexuality is involved, the mania
      may be termed a fetish. Thus, teratophobia would be an inordinate fear of
      monsters, while teratophilia would be an unhealthy (possibly sexual)
      attraction to them. See the following lists of phobias for ideas on what
      sorts of disorders could manifest as manias.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="real-world-phobias"></a>Real-World Phobias:</b>
      The following list provides examples of phobias from the real world that
      lend themselves to inclusion in a d20 campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain real-world phobias can easily be broadened to include monstrous
      creatures and specific magic effects in a fantasy environment. For
      example, ophidiophobia (fear of snakes) could be extended to include
      medusae and other snakelike creatures, or ichthyophobia (fear of fish)
      could be extended to include aquatic creatures with fishlike qualities,
      such as the locathah and the sahuagin.

      Dissociative Disorders
    </h6>
      Individuals suffering from dissociative disorders cannot maintain a
      complete awareness of themselves, their surroundings, or time. The
      disorder often involves some great previous trauma that is too terrible to
      remember. Characters who have gone insane from an encounter with powerful
      monsters often suffer from some form of dissociative disorder.
    <p><b><a id="dissociative-amnesia-psychogenic-amnesia"></a>Dissociative Amnesia (Psychogenic Amnesia):</b>
      This is the inability to recall important personal information, brought on
      by a desire to avoid unpleasant memories. The character must make a DC 20
      Will save to recall such details or the cause of the amnesia. Since the
      horror of evil creatures and disturbing truths is the probable cause of
      this amnesia, as an optional rule the GM may choose to reset the
      character�s <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#knowledge-forbidden-lore">Knowledge (forbidden lore)</a> modifier to +0 and her maximum
      Sanity to 99 while this disorder holds sway: The horror returns only when
      the character�s memories do.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="dissociative-fuge"></a>Dissociative Fugue:</b>
      The character flees from home or work and cannot recall her past. Once the
      flight halts, the character may assume an entirely new identity.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="dissosiative-identity-disorder-multiple-personality-disorder"></a>Dissociative Identity Disorder (Multiple Personality Disorder):</b>
      The character appears to harbor more than one personality, each of which
      is dominant at times and has its own distinct behavior, name, and even
      gender. The player needs to keep track of the character�s different
      personalities. (Each one has the same ability scores and game statistics,
      but different goals, outlooks, and attitudes.)
    </p>
    <h6><a id="eating-disorders"></a>
      Eating Disorders
    </h6>
      These disorders can be incredibly debilitating and even lead to
      starvation. They are conditions that may continue for many years,
      sometimes continually endangering the patient.
    <p><b><a id="anorexia-nervosa"></a>Anorexia Nervosa:</b>
      The character has an overpowering fear of becoming fat and consequently
      loses weight, as well as taking <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#ability-damaged">Constitution damage</a> (at a rate of 1d8
      points per week). Even when she is no more than skin and bones, the
      character continues to see herself as overweight. Without intervention,
      she may literally starve herself to death.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="bulimia-nervosa"></a>Bulimia Nervosa:</b>
      The character frequently eats large amounts of food during secret binges.
      An eating episode may continue until abdominal distress or self-induced
      vomiting occurs. Feelings of depression and guilt frequently follow such
      episodes.

    <h6><a id="impulse-control-disorders"></a>
      Impulse Control Disorders
    </h6>
      These disorders include compulsive gambling, pathological lying,
      kleptomania (compulsive stealing), and pyromania (the compulsion to set
      fires).
    <p><b><a id="intermittent-explosive-disorder"></a>Intermittent Explosive Disorder:</b>
      The character is recognizably impulsive and aggressive, and at times gives
      way to uncontrollable rages that result in assault or destruction of
      property.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="mood-disorders"></a>
      Mood Disorders
    </h6>
      These disorders affect the victim�s attitude and outlook. Mild mood
      disorders can be almost impossible to detect without prolonged contact
      with an individual, but severe disorders usually have noticeable symptoms.
    <p><b><a id="depression"></a>Depression:</b>
      Symptoms of this illness include changes in appetite, weight gain or loss,
      too much or too little sleep, persistent feeling of tiredness or
      sluggishness, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt, leading in severe
      cases to hallucinations, delusions, stupor, or thoughts of suicide. All
      attack rolls, saves, and checks take a -4 morale penalty. A predisposition
      to use alcohol or other mood-altering substances in an attempt at
      self-medication exists. A character suffering from severe chronic
      depression may give up virtually all effort from feelings of
      hopelessness � for example, deciding not to get out of bed for two years.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="mood-disorder-mania"></a>Mania:</b>
      The character has a fairly constant euphoric or possibly irritable mood.
      Symptoms include a general increase in activity, talkativeness, increased
      self-esteem to the point of delusion, decreased need for sleep, being
      easily distracted, willingness for dangerous or imprudent activities such
      as reckless driving, delusions, hallucinations, and bizarre behavior. All
      attack rolls, saves, and checks take a -4 morale penalty A predisposition
      to use alcohol or other substances in an attempt at self-medication
      exists.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="bipolar-mood-disorder"></a>Bipolar Mood Disorder:</b>
      The character oscillates between mood states, sometimes staying in one
      mood for weeks at a time, sometimes rapidly switching from one to another.
      Also known as manic depressive.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="personality-disorders"></a>
      Personality Disorders
    </h6>
      These long-term disorders have almost constant effects on a character�s
      behavior, making it difficult for him to interact with others and often
      making him unpleasant to be around as well. This is an important point to
      keep in mind when roleplaying � few players want to spend time with another
      player character suffering from a personality disorder.
    <p>
      In game terms, the character takes a -4 penalty on all Charisma-based
      checks. In addition, the attitudes of NPCs the character encounters are
      shifted in a negative direction. When determining NPC atitudes, the
      player must make a Charisma check for the character. On a successful
      check, the attitude of the NPC in question shifts one step toward hostile;
      on a failed check, the attitude of the NPC in question shifts two steps
      toward hostile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personality disorders are classified in the following categories.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="antisocial"></a>Antisocial:</b>
      Short-sighted and reckless behavior, habitual liar, confrontational, fails
      to meet obligations (job, bills, relationships), disregards rights and
      feelings of others.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="avoidant"></a>Avoidant:</b>
      Oversensitive to rejection, low self-esteem, socially withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="borderline"></a>Borderline:</b>
      Rapid mood shifts, impulsive, unable to control temper, chronic boredom.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="compulsive"></a>Compulsive:</b>
      Perfectionist, authoritarian, indecisive from fear of making mistakes,
      difficulty expressing emotions.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="dependent"></a>Dependent:</b>
      Lacks self-confidence; seeks another to look up to, follow, and
      subordinate herself to (�codependent�).
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="histrionic"></a>Histrionic:</b>
      Overly dramatic, craves attention and excitement, overreacts, displays
      temper tantrums, may threaten suicide if thwarted.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="narcissistic"></a>Narcissistic:</b>
      Exaggerated sense of self-importance, craves attention and admiration,
      considers others� rights and feelings as of lesser importance.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="passive-aggressive"></a>Passive-Aggressive:</b>
      Procrastinator, stubborn, intentionally forgetful, deliberately
      inefficient. Sabotages own performance on a regular basis.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="paranoid"></a>Paranoid:</b>
      Jealous, easily offended, suspicious, humorless, secretive, vigilant;
      exaggerates magnitude of offenses against oneself, refuses to accept
      blame.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="schizoid"></a>Schizoid:</b>
      Emotionally cold, aloof, has few friends; indifferent to praise or
      criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      GMs should realize that, while these traits may work for an interesting
      NPC from whom the players must extract information or a favor, their
      antisocial nature makes them ill-suited for members of an adventuring
      party.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="psychosexual-disorders"></a>
      Psychosexual Disorders
    </h6>
      Recognizable disorders of this type include transsexualism (a belief that
      one is actually a member of the opposite sex), impaired sexual desire or
      function, nymphomania and satyriasis (inordinate and uncontrollable sexual
      appetite in women and men, respectively), and paraphilia (requirement of
      an abnormal sexual stimulus, such as sadism, masochism, necrophilia,
      pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, fetishism, or bestiality).
    <p>
      Most of these disorders could make players of the afflicted characters
      uncomfortable and thus are not appropriate for most roleplaying groups,
      although they can make for striking (if unpleasant) NPCs.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="psychospecies-disorders"></a>
      Psychospecies Disorders
    </h6>
      These disorders are specific to fantasy environments and involve the
      victim of one believing that she is a different type of creature. A victim
      might believe that she is a construct (and therefore immune to critical
      hits) or any other creature type that she has encountered. When a victim
      has a psychospecies disorder associated with a creature that has specific
      weaknesses (for example, a human thinking he�s a <a style="color: #579eb6" href="monstersTtoZ.html#vampire">vampire</a>), then the
      victim�s behavior changes become more noticeable (such as a fear of holy
      symbols and sunlight).
    <h6><a id="schizophrenia-and-other-psychotic-disorders"></a>
      Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders
    </h6>
      A psychotic character experiences a break with reality. Symptoms can
      include delusions, hallucinations, and cognitive impairment. In general,
      only alchemical substances or magic can treat these kinds of disorders.
      Note, however, that many psychotic characters suffer from the delusion
      that nothing is wrong with them, and hence they feel no need to take their
      medication.
    <p><b><a id="schizophrenia-schizophreniform-disorder-dementia-praecox"></a>Schizophrenia (Schizophreniform Disorder, Dementia Praecox):</b>
      A schizophrenic character�s attention span and ability to concentration
      are greatly diminished; to reflect this, use only one-half of the
      character�s normal skill modifier on any skill check requiring
      attentiveness (such as <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#disable-device">Disable Device</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#spot">Spot</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#search">Search</a>, <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#open-lock">Open Lock</a>, and of
      course <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#concentration">Concentration</a>). Symptoms include bizarre delusions, paranoia,
      auditory hallucinations (�hearing voices�), incoherent speech, emotional
      detachment, social withdrawal, bizarre behavior, and a lack of the sense
      of self.
    </p>
    <p>
      A schizophrenic character may fit into one of the following categories.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="undifferentiated-schizophrenia"></a>Undifferentiated:</i>
      Impaired cognitive function, emotional detachment.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="disorganized-schizophrenia"></a>Disorganized:</i>
      Inappropriate behavior, shallow emotional responses, delusions,
      hallucinations.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="catatonic-schizophrenia"></a>Catatonic:</i>
      Mutism (loss of ability to talk), extreme compliance, absence of all
      voluntary movements, complete immobility (�statuism�).
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="paranoid-schizophrenia"></a>Paranoid:</i>
      Delusions of persecution, illogical thinking, hallucinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Symptoms from more than one type can occur in the same individual, along
      with mood disorders (see above). For example, catatonic schizophrenics
      sometimes have manic episodes of extreme activity alternating with periods
      of complete withdrawal. Schizophrenia brought on by sudden stress is
      called acute schizophrenia; characters who go insane and babble of vast
      global conspiracies usually are diagnosed as suffering from �acute
      paranoid schizophrenia.�
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="other-psychotic-disorders"></a>Other Psychotic Disorders:</b>
      By some definitions, all severe mental illnesses are classified as
      psychoses, including mood disorders, dementia, and anxiety disorders. This
      section deals with some of the interesting behavioral syndromes that may
      turn up in your game.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="amok"></a>Amok:</i>
      �Running amok,� an outburst of violence and aggressive or homicidal
      behavior directed at people and property. Amnesia, return to
      consciousness, and exhaustion occur following the episode. During a
      killing spree, the character utilizes whatever weapons are on hand.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="boufee-detirant"></a>Boufee Detirant:</i>
      Sudden outburst of aggressive, agitated behavior and marked confusion,
      sometimes accompanied by visual and auditory hallucinations or paranoia.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="brain-fag"></a>Brain Fag:</i>
      Impaired concentration and feelings of fatigue, pains in the neck and
      head, a sense that worms are crawling inside one�s head.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="ghost-sickness"></a>Ghost Sickness:</i>
      Weakness, loss of appetite, feelings of suffocation, nightmares, and a
      pervasive feeling of terror, attributed as a sending from witches or
      malign otherworldly powers.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="piblokto"></a>Piblokto:</i>
      �Arctic madness,� wherein the afflicted rips off clothing and runs howling
      like an animal through the snow.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="susto"></a>Susto:</i>
      A variety of somatic and psychological symptoms attributed to a traumatic
      incident so frightening that it dislodged the victim�s spirit from her
      body.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="taijin-kyofusho"></a>Taijin Kyofusho:</i>
      �Face-to-face� phobia, an intense anxiety when in the presence of other
      people; fearfulness that one�s appearance, odor, or behavior is offensive.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="voodoo-death"></a>Voodoo Death:</i>
      Belief that a hex or curse can bring about misfortune, disability, and
      death through some spiritual mechanism. Often the victim self-fulfills the
      hexer�s prophecy by refusing to eat and drink, resulting in dehydration
      and starvation.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="wacinko"></a>Wacinko:</i>
      Anger, withdrawal, mutism, and immobility, leading to illness and suicide.
    </p>
    <p><i><a id="wendigo-syndrome"></a>Wendigo Syndrome:</i>
      The afflicted believes she is a personification of the Wendigo, a
      cannibalistic creature with an icy heart.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="shared-paranoid-disorder-shared-delusional-disorder-folie-a-deux"></a>Shared Paranoid Disorder (Shared Delusional Disorder, <i>Folie a Deux</i>)</b>
      The character takes on the delusional system of another paranoid
      individual from being in close contact with that person.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="sleep-disorders"></a>
      Sleep Disorders
    </h6>
      These disorders include insomnia (character has difficulty falling asleep
      or staying asleep) and narcolepsy (character frequently falls asleep,
      almost anywhere and at inappropriate times). Characters performing
      demanding tasks such as engaging in combat or casting a spell may, when
      stressed, need to make DC 15 <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#concentration">Concentration</a> checks to stay awake and not
      put themselves in a dangerous situation.
    <p><b><a id="night-terrors"></a>Night Terrors:</b>
      A sleeping character wakes after a few hours of sleep, usually screaming
      in terror. Pulse and breathing are rapid, pupils are dilated, and hair
      stands on end. The character is confused and hard to calm down. Night
      terrors are similar to ordinary nightmares, but much more intense and
      disruptive.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="somnambulism"></a>Somnambulism:</b>
      Sleepwalking. As with night terrors, this behavior occurs in the first few
      hours of sleep. An episode may last up to 30 minutes. During the episode,
      the character�s face is blank and staring, and she can be roused only with
      difficulty. Once awake, she recalls nothing of the activity.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="somatoform-disorders"></a>
      Somatoform Disorders
    </h6>
      A somatoform disorder may be diagnosed when a character experiences
      physical symptoms that cannot be explained by an actual physical injury or
      disease.
    <p><b><a id="somatization-disorder"></a>Somatization Disorder:</b>
      The character suffers from a physical ailment or diseaselike effect, with
      symptoms ranging from dizziness and impotence to blindness and intense
      pain. The <a style="color: #579eb6" href="skillsAll.html#heal">Heal</a> skill cannot identify any physical cause for the symptoms,
      and magical healing has no effect. The victim does not believe that her
      symptoms represent a specific disease. All attack rolls, saves, and checks
      take a -2 penalty.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="conversion-disorder"></a>Conversion Disorder:</b>
      The character reports dysfunctions that suggest a physical disorder but,
      though they are involuntary, the symptoms actually provide a way for the
      victim to avoid something undesirable or a way to garner attention and
      caring, a condition called Munchausenism. Symptoms range from painful
      headaches to paralysis or blindness. With the condition known as Reverse
      Munchausenism, a character projects ill health onto others and may even
      arrange injuries or illnesses for them so that she can thereafter take
      care of them. All attack rolls, saves, and checks take a -2 penalty.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="hypochondriasis"></a>Hypochondriasis:</b>
      Character believes she suffers from a serious disease. No physical cause
      for reported symptoms can be found, but the character continues to believe
      that the disease or condition exists, often with serious consequences to
      her normal life.
    </p>
    <p><b><a id="body-dysmorphic-disorder"></a>Body Dysmorphic Disorder:</b>
      Character suffers from perceived flaws in appearance, usually of the face,
      or of the hips or legs. Behavior may alter in unexpected ways to cover up
      the flaws or to calm anxieties.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="substance-abuse-disorder"></a>
      Substance Abuse Disorder
    </h6>
      A character with a substance abuse disorder finds solace in using a drug,
      becomes addicted to it, and spends much time maintaining, concealing, and
      indulging the habit. Drugs include alcohol, amphetamines, cocaine,
      hallucinogens, marijuana, nicotine, opium (especially morphine and
      heroin), sedatives, and more fantastic substances present in the campaign
      world (see <a style="color: #579eb6" href="#sample-drugs">Sample Drugs</a>, earlier in this section).
    <p>
      A character under the sway of such a substance should feel the personal
      struggle daily. Will saving throws might be used to resist or succumb
      symbolically to cravings, especially just before periods of stress (for
      example, just before a confrontation or likely battle with evil cultists).
      All attack rolls, saves, and checks take a -2 morale penalty because of
      withdrawal symptoms. Sanity losses could occur from binges or bad trips.
      Some characters might find that drugs promote communication with alien
      entities and deities, and that dreams about them become ever more vivid
      and horrifying, Conversely, such substances might function as medications,
      deadening a character�s fears and offering temporary defenses against
      Sanity loss.
    </p>
    <h6><a id="other-disorders"></a>
      Other Disorders
    </h6>
      Other disorders exist in common parlance, but most of these are actually
      symptoms or specific instances of disorders already mentioned above. These
      include quixotism (seeing the supernatural everywhere, even in the most
      mundane surroundings), panzaism (seeing the most extraordinary events as
      ordinary and rational), and megalomania (delusions of power, wealth, fame,
      and ability). Use or ignore these as suits your campaign, or invent new
      categories of madness to reflect the chaos that lies just below the
      brittle surface of Lovecraft�s world.
    <h5><a id="psychiatric-glossary"></a>
      A PSYCHIATRIC GLOSSARY
    </h5>
      The following words are defined in terms of a real-world understanding of
      insanity; some of them (illusion, for example) have different meanings in
      a d20 game context. As with all aspects of the Sanity variant, GMs need to
      determine how each race and culture within the campaign world views
      insanity and how capable each race and culture is of treating mental
      disorders in order to know which of these words might come into play.
    <p><b><a id="glossary-affect"></a>Affect:</b>
