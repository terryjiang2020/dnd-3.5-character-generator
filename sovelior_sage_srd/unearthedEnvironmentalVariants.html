Racial variants are a great way add diversity to your game without
drastically changing the ecology of your world. One method of altering
the existing races is to introduce environmental variants, a number of
which are presented here.






      <p> You may decide that one or more of these variants represent
the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; version of a given race in your world. For
stance, in a desert-based campaign the desert races presented below
could replace the normal versions of the races.
      </p>











      <p> Alternatively, these variants could coexist with the standard
races (or even with other variants) in your world. For example, you can
use them as world-building tools&mdash;the existence of racial
offshoots may constitute living proof of an ancient racial migration in
response to some disaster.
      </p>











      <p> Each racial variant modifies the race to which it is applied
(hereafter called the standard race) in minor ways. All racial traits
of the standard race &mdash; racial skill bonuses, bonus feats, special
sensory capabilities (such as darkvision and low-light vision), ability
modifiers, combat bonuses against specific foes, and racial weapon
proficiencies &mdash; are retained unless the variant specifies
otherwise. For instance, a human retains his extra skill points and
extra feat at 1st level, a dwarf retains his stonecunning ability, and
an elf retains her ability to spot secret doors, unless the variant
description specifically indicates otherwise.
      </p>











      <p> Many of the variant races described in this section provide
alternate ability score adjustments. In these cases, the adjustments
given here supersede the standard race's adjustments. For example, the <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="#aquatic-goblin">aquatic goblin's</a> ability score adjustments are -2 Strength, +2 Constitution, and -2 Charisma. These adjustments take the place of the <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="monstersG.html#goblin">goblin's</a> normal -2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, and -2 Charisma.
      </p>











      <p> Because humans are, by nature, the most adaptable of races,
environmental variants are generally not included for humans. The
exception is <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="#aquatic-humans">aquatic humans</a>,
which, due to their ability to live and breathe underwater, are
sufficiently different from other humans to warrant an environmental
variant.
      </p>












      <h2><a id="aquatic-races"></a>Aquatic Races</h2>





Beneath the surface of the ocean lies an exotic and a alien world,
complete with canyons, mountains, volcanoes, and forests. Inky depths
conceal sunken cities, sleeping deities, and titanic monsters. For
residents of the aquatic realm, the sunny world of the air is as
mysterious and unknown as the black depths of the sea.






      <p> Players wanting their characters to be ocean dwellers can use
these variants. Or, their characters might encounter these races while
journeying beneath the sea.
      </p>











      <p>
 The following cultural attributes are common to most aquatic races.
      </p>












      <h6>Personality</h6>





An aquatic race usually shares the temperament and interests of the
standard race, but its members tend to be more serene than their
landborn cousins.






      <h6>Physical Description</h6>





A water creature is taller and thinner than a standard member of her
race. Her feet and hands are webbed to facilitate swimming. (<a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="#aquatic-elves">Aquatic elves</a>
even have fins along their limbs that serve the same purpose.) A water
creature's skin ranges from pale green to dark blue. Her hair usually
matches her skin color but may be one or two shades darker.






      <p> Water dwellers wear very little clothing, and what they do
wear tends to cling tightly to their bodies. Some favor jewelry made of
coral and other undersea treasures.
      </p>












      <h6>Relations</h6>





The attitudes of water creatures tend to be very similar to those of
their landborn cousins. Members of aquatic races generally treat
landborn creatures with guarded pleasantness on the rare occasions when
they meet.






      <h6>Alignment</h6>





Having avoided most of the political, economic, and military turmoil of
the surface world, water creatures tend to take a much more placid view
of life than their landborn cousins do. Members of an aquatic race
favor neutrality in at least one aspect of alignment, if not both.






      <h6>Lands</h6>





The civilizations of water dwellers often mirror those of their
standard races, though water folk favor more loosely organized
governments and more open societies. Water creatures generally have
plenty of space available for building, so they rarely structure their
habitats as densely populated cities. Instead, undersea races prefer to
maintain loosely defined territories in which families and individuals
can carve out their own niches.






      <h6>Religion</h6>





Water creatures usually pay homage to at least one deity related to
oceans, storms, or nature. Otherwise, their worshiping habits are
similar to those of their standard races.






      <h6>Language</h6>





Water creatures speak any languages spoken by members of their standard
race. Many also learn Aquan to facilitate communication with other
underwater creatures.






      <h6>Adventurers</h6>





While there are plenty of adventures to be found beneath the waves,
water creatures occasionally venture onto land to fulfill some
important goal. Some are lured by the alien ways of the surface people,
others feel a wanderlust that can be tamed only by walking the earth.






      <h4><a id="aquatic-racial-traits"></a>General Aquatic Racial Traits</h4>












      <p>
 All aquatic races have the following racial traits.
      </p>











      <ul>


















        <li>Aquatic: An aquatic race gains the <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="monsterTypes.html#aquatic">aquatic subtype</a>.
An aquatic creature can breathe underwater. It cannot also breathe air
unless it also has the amphibious special quality. An aquatic creature
can hold its breath outside the water for 2 rounds per point of
Constitution. After that, it begins to suffocate.</li>





























        <li>Swim speed: An aquatic creature always has a swim speed. It can move through water at its swim speed without making <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="skillsAll.html#swim">Swim</a>
checks. It has a 8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some
action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim
check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action
while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.</li>






























        <li>Bonus Language: Aquan. Aquatic races are familiar with the language of water-based creatures.</li>






















      </ul>












      <h4><a id="aquatic-race-level-adjustment"></a>Aquatic Race Level Adjustments</h4>






 None of the aquatic races have level adjustments when your entire campaign is set underwater and all the PCs have the <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="monsterTypes.html#aquatic">aquatic subtype</a>,
or when playing a nonaquatic campaign. The advantages gained by an
aquatic character when in an aquatic environment even out with those of
other aquatic characters, and their disadvantages in nonaquatic
environments make up for any advantages they might enjoy.






      <p> However, when a mix of aquatic and nonaquatic characters
occurs in an aquatic or ship-based campaign, aquatic characters enjoy a
distinct advantage over their land-based cousins. In this case,
consider applying a +1 level adjustment for all aquatic races, due to
their swim speed, improved low-light vision or darkvision, and other
special abilities.
      </p>

authority or higher social position.

 Your campaign might be set in a snow-swept expanse of glaciers, mountains, and
  icy seas. Settlements cluster around sources of heat, including hot springs and
  volcanic vents. Frozen in the ice are relics of a forgotten, warmer time. Strange
  creatures descend from the glaciers, wreaking havoc and drawing adventurers like
  beacons.





      <p>

 Players wanting their characters to be nonhuman arctic dwellers can build characters
  using these variants, or their characters could encounter these races while journeying
  across the ice and snow.
      </p>











      <p>
 The following cultural attributes are common to most arctic races.
      </p>












      <h6>Personality</h6>






 Nearly all ice dwellers are more grim and humorless than members of their standard
  races. Efficiency in word and deed is crucial to survival in the harsh arctic
  realms, so arctic creatures tend to get straight to the point in conversation,
  and they have little patience for those who speak in riddles or half truths. Because
  they must struggle for even the most basic existence in the severe climate of
  the arctic regions, excess of any kind is offensive to them. Thus, they tend to
  be frugal and to value hard work for the benefit of all over individual accomplishment.






      <h6>Physical Description</h6>






 An ice dweller is hardier than a member of his standard race, and he tends to
  carry extra weight on his frame even when in exceptional physical condition. His
  skin can be any shade from pale white to light blue, and his hair and eyes can
  be of any color found among members of his standard race.






      <p>
 Arctic creatures wear many layers of clothing as protection against the intense
  cold of their homeland. They do not particularly value jewelry or other ornamentation,
  and they carry only what they need to survive,
      </p>












      <h6>Relations</h6>






 Those who spend their lives in the bleak and comfortless arctic regions treat
  outsiders with guarded wariness, if not outright distrust. Though members of most
  arctic tribes are willing to welcome strangers in from the cold, they tend to
  watch such newcomers very closely and hurry them on their way as soon as possible.
  Of course, a stranger with a particularly useful skill may be invited to stay &mdash; it
  is difficult to turn away a strong back or a skilled toolmaker in the desolate
  and frigid lands where the arctic races make their homes.






      <p>
 In addition to their particular distrust of outsiders, members of arctic races
  tend to harbor many of the same prejudices held by their standard races.

      </p>












      <h6>Alignment</h6>






 Arctic races are generally inclined toward the alignment preferences of their
  standard races.






      <h6>Lands</h6>






 It is difficult for any living thing to survive in the frozen wastelands where
  arctic races live. Thus, most other races know little or nothing of their arctic
  cousins, and what they do know is often tainted by legend and hearsay. Most arctic
  creatures make their homes in ice caves or beneath the ground, although some tribes
  have adapted to life on the surface by building ice houses and other structures
  that can survive fierce winter storms.







      <h6>Religion</h6>






 Arctic races worship deities typical of their standard races.






      <h6>Adventurers</h6>






 Ice dwellers must exert themselves merely to survive in the bitter climate of
  their homelands, so they tend to make ideal adventurers. Those who dislike the
  constant struggle of life in the arctic often travel far from their homes in search
  of comfort, if not adventure. Occasionally, arctic tribes send emissaries into
  temperate lands to gather aid against particularly strong enemies or to secure
  emergency stores during hard times.

 Arctic orcs are primitive herders, eking out a living on the slopes of volcanic
  mountains and building their crude huts near hot springs or steam vents. They
  herd woolly cattle, caribou, and elk. As a result, they control large sources
  of meat, water, and heat &mdash; all things coveted by others living in or traveling through
  the arctic. What they don't have, they take by force.






      <p>
 Arctic orcs stand ever vigilant against attackers and thieves when they're not
  making preemptive strikes against those foolish enough to settle near their territory.
      </p>











      <p>
 Occasionally an individual orc questions the need for constant battle, or seeks
  strategies other than brute force. Such iconoclasts often leave their tribes &mdash; at
  least temporarily &mdash; to become adventurers.

      <h2><a id="desert-races"></a>Desert Races</h2>






 In a campaign set in a vast desert, water is worth its weight in gold, and shifting
  sands occasionally reveal long-buried ruins of forgotten civilizations.






      <p>
 Players wanting their characters to be nonhuman desert dwellers can build characters
  using these variants, or their characters could encounter these races while journeying
  across the sands.
      </p>











      <p>
 The following cultural attributes are common to most desert races.
      </p>












      <h6>Personality</h6>






 Members of the desert races are usually quite friendly, although during the day
  they may seem brusque as they hurry to get about their business and out of the
  oppressive heat. At night, however, they offer warm greetings and good drink to
  any travelers who happen upon their camps. To them, a stranger is neither friend
  nor foe &mdash; just good company whose presence brings a moment of joy.






      <h6>Physical Description</h6>






 A desert creature is usually hardier in build than a member of his standard race.
  Bronze skin and dark hair are typical, since such adaptations tend to make life
  in the scorching desert more comfortable.






      <p> The clothing favored by desert creatures tends to be loose and light, and they
wear just enough to keep the heat off during the day and the chill off at night.
Most desert creatures wear headgear that not only protects them from the sun but
also provides some warmth during cold desert nights.
      </p>












      <h6>Relations</h6>






 Most desert dwellers are not choosy about trading partners, but many share the
  prejudices of their standard races. Regardless of race, most share a dislike of
  the scavenging <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="#desert-kobolds">desert kobolds</a> and the omnipresent nuisance of <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="#desert-goblins">desert goblins</a>.






      <h6>Alignment</h6>






 The predominant alignment among desert races is neutral. It takes equal parts
  of law and chaos to survive under the harsh desert sun. Evil folk soon find themselves
  without friends, and to be isolated in an environment that cannot long support
  individuals means certain death. In contrast, those who place the principles of
  goodness over the needs of survival often find themselves in dire straits. Life
  in the desert often requires one to meet one's own needs before tending to another's.







      <h6>Lands</h6>






 Except for <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="#desert-dwarves">desert dwarves</a> and <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="#desert-gnomes">desert gnomes</a>, most desert dwellers are nomads who
  wander from one settlement to the next in search of vital supplies. Thus, they
  have no true lands of their own. Desert dwarves, however, are very protective
  of their settlements and private oases, and they are willing to defend them to
  the death if need be.







      <h6>Religion</h6>






 Desert creatures tend to have the same religious preferences as members of their
  standard races, with an emphasis on the worship of sun, light, or fire deities.







      <h6>Language</h6>






 Members of desert races speak the same languages as their standard races.






      <h6>Adventurers</h6>






 Opportunity for adventure is common on the burning sands. Denizens of the desert
  may turn to adventuring because they find the scavenger's life too difficult, or
  simply because they crave the rewards of the adventuring life. Although nomadic
  societies are often made up of networks of extended families, those who leave
  them to pursue their own goals rarely return.

 Because of their skill with stone and engineering, dwarves are acknowledged masters

 In the desert, elves follow nomadic lifestyles. They herd horses, cattle, and
  goats across the sands, sleeping during the day and working or traveling at night.
  Their wandering takes them many places and puts them in contact with many cultures.
  As a result, they are welcome everywhere for the news and exotic trade goods they carry.

 Desert goblins take up adventuring for many reasons. While most goblins are neutral

 Many tribes of <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="#desert-orcs">orcs</a> live in isolated desert canyons or the ruins of ancient cities,
  now abandoned to the sands. Often their mutual dependence on sources of fresh

  in places where full-blooded orcs are not.

 Like gnomes, halflings are most likely to be active during the day. Most other
  races regard them somewhat like cats, in that they appear whether invited or not,
  work at what they want when they want, and disappear without prior notice. A desert
  gnome proverb observes that &ldquo;Halflings in your town are a source of trouble, but
  at least they don't tolerate competition.&rdquo;

 Desert kobolds live like scaly, intelligent rats, hiding in forgotten corners
  of settlements, living just over the dunes from trading posts, and always reappearing
  right after the residents think they've finally been killed off.





      <p>
 Desert kobolds claim they were among the first to settle the deserts, and that
  <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="#desert-gnomes">gnomes</a> threw them out into the wilderness. Though their survival relies on goods
  available at oasis settlements and trading posts, desert kobolds hate the gnomes
  who often build and run such settlements.
      </p>











      <p>
 The life of a desert kobold is one of constant fear, which motivates them to build
  traps and fortifications and to ambush intruders. Some few kobolds, however, seek
  peace of mind through personal power and boon companions. These rare individuals
  become adventurers.

 Desert orcs are martial creatures who live for battle. Prowess in battle is their
  only measure of social standing, and they don't particularly care if weaker races
  get hurt when orcs test their skills. In fact, the chief difference between desert
  orcs and desert goblinoids is that the former never accept defeat &mdash; when desert orcs
  attack, they conquer or die trying.





      <p>
 Desert orcs live in a perpetual state of war, participating in eternal night sorties
  from their isolated desert canyons and ancient ruined cities to attack settlements
  and expand their territory. Only the burning sun, and their weakness when in it,
  keeps them from ruling the desert.
      </p>











      <p>
 Occasionally an individual orc questions the need for constant battle, or seeks
  strategies other than brute force. Such iconoclasts often leave their tribes &mdash; at
  least temporarily &mdash; to become adventurers.

      <h2><a id="jungle-races"></a>Jungle Races</h2>






 A vast equatorial jungle, where tiny trading posts hacked from the vegetation
  dot riversides, giant vines and tree roots conceal cities of forgotten societies,
  and races that predate human civilization struggle to maintain their ancient traditions,
  makes a compelling setting for a campaign.





      <p>
 Players wanting their characters to be nonhuman jungle dwellers can build characters
  using these variants, or their characters could encounter these races while journeying
  through the green labyrinth of the jungle.
      </p>











      <p>
 The following cultural attributes are common to most jungle dwelling races.
      </p>












      <h6>Personality</h6>






 Jungle races tend to be very territorial, and they guard their families and clans
  closely. They are not quick to trust strangers, but they form strong bonds with
  outsiders who do manage to earn their trust.






      <h6>Physical Description</h6>






 A jungle dweller looks very much like a member of her standard race. Typically,
  only a jungle creature's rough, hide-sewn clothing and unkempt appearance mark
  her as unusual.






      <h6>Relations</h6>






 Members of the jungle races are very territorial, so they interact with other
  creatures only when absolutely necessary. They often maintain good trading relations
  with other wild races, but they rarely trade with civilized cultures except through
  intermediaries such as local druids or rangers.






      <h6>Alignment</h6>






 Jungle races are often more chaotic than members of their standard races, rejecting
  the typical strictures of civilized society. However, their loyalty to family
  is high.






      <h6>Lands</h6>






 Jungle races avoid heavily populated areas, settling in remote areas of wilderness.






      <h6>Religion</h6>






 Members of the jungle races tend to be more superstitious than religious. Most
  rely on religious leaders (some of whom are actually <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="npcClasses.html#adept">adepts</a> of great power) to
  give them spiritual guidance. Individuals may pray to aspects of animal and nature
  deities, but only rarely does one of them achieve true communion with such a deity.






      <h6>Adventurers</h6>






 Jungle dwellers may set out into the world for a variety of reasons. They may
  need the help of a group of civilized folk to avert a prophesied disaster, or
  they might be asked by tribal elders to retrieve an artifact from an ancient burial
  site to protect them from a coming conflict. Often, such a quest is only the beginning
  of a jungle creature's adventuring career. She may be lured away from her people
  by the wonders of civilized society, or she may form a bond with outsiders who
  will never be welcome in her tribal lands.

 Jungle elves are somewhat more primal than their baseline counterparts. In many

  of trees, vines, and animals, leaving just a shadowy remnant of the population

 Jungle gnomes live in and along the mighty rivers that wind through the jungles.
  A gnome jungle town is often a collection of boats tied together across a river,
  with channels to allow passing vessels through (after they pay a toll, of course).
  Jungle gnomes are also seen traveling the rivers, trading what they can find to
  those they meet along the way.

 If monkeys were evil and could speak, they'd be a lot like jungle goblins. Jungle
  goblins are territorial, tree-dwelling savages with a sadistic streak a mile wide.
  Their skills at climbing and moving from tree to tree, combined with their cunning
  and vicious nature, cause even other <a style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);" href="monsterTypes.html#goblinoid">goblinoids</a> to respect them.





      <p>
 Jungle goblins generally take up adventuring to gain personal power and serve
  their ambitions within their clans, or because they somehow lack the evil nature
  of the rest of their kind.

  climbing. It retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing,
  and opponents get no special bonus on their attacks against a climbing jungle goblin.
  Also, jungle goblins add their Dexterity modifier to Climb checks instead of their

  that the cities were obviously built by and for people larger than the little
  reptilian humanoids. Jungle kobolds lack the cowardice common to other kobolds,
  thanks to the isolation of their mountain peak homes. By all reports they show

 If gorillas were evil and could speak, they'd be a lot like jungle orcs. Jungle
  orcs live a simple existence, moving through the jungle hunting and gathering
  food in clan groups (equivalent in size to the squads given in the orc monster
  entry, plus 150% noncombatants). Although combat is common within the clans, it's
  relatively bloodless and hardly ever lethal. Only when jungle orcs encounter other
  clans or other races do they show the true extent of their violent, evil nature.





      <p>
 Conquest is a baffling concept to jungle orcs. They attack, take whatever strikes
  their fancy, and move on. They lack the discipline required to maintain the things
  they steal, so they always seek weakly defended settlements and caravans to replace
  those things that break or wear out in the humidity of the jungle.
      </p>











      <p>
 Occasionally an individual jungle orc questions the need for constant battle,
  or seeks strategies other than brute force. These are often the more intelligent
  members of their clans. Such iconoclasts often leave the jungle &mdash; at least
  temporarily &mdash; to become adventurers.
