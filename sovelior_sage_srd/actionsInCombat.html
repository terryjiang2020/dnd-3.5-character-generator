              THE COMBAT ROUND
            </h5>

            <p class="initial">
              Each round represents 6 seconds in the game world. A round
              presents an opportunity for each character involved in a combat
              situation to take an action.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each round�s activity begins with the character with the highest
              initiative result and then proceeds, in order, from there. Each
              round of a combat uses the same initiative order. When a
              character�s turn comes up in the initiative sequence, that
              character performs his entire round�s worth of actions. (For
              exceptions, see Attacks of Opportunity and Special Initiative
              Actions.)
            </p>
            <p>
              For almost all purposes, there is no relevance to the end of a
              round or the beginning of a round. A round can be a segment of
              game time starting with the first character to act and ending with
              the last, but it usually means a span of time from one round to
              the same initiative count in the next round. Effects that last a
              certain number of rounds end just before the same initiative count
              that they began on.

              ACTION TYPES
            </h5>
            <p class="initial">
              An action�s type essentially tells you how long the action takes
              to perform (within the framework of the 6-second combat round) and
              how movement is treated. There are four types of actions: standard
              actions, move actions, full-round actions, and free actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a normal round, you can perform a standard action and a move
              action, or you can perform a full-round action. You can also
              perform one or more free actions. You can always take a move
              action in place of a standard action.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some situations (such as in a surprise round), you may be
              limited to taking only a single move action or standard action.
            </p>

            <p><a id="standard-action"></a>
              <b>Standard Action</b>: A standard action allows you to do
              something, most commonly make an attack or cast a spell. See
              Table: Actions in Combat for other standard actions.
            </p>
            <p><a id="move-action"></a>
              <b>Move Action</b>: A move action allows you to move your speed or
              perform an action that takes a similar amount of time. See Table:
              Actions in Combat.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can take a move action in place of a standard action. If you
              move no actual distance in a round (commonly because you have
              swapped your move for one or more equivalent actions), you can
              take one 5-foot step either before, during, or after the action.
            </p>

            <p><a id="full-round-action"></a>
              <b>Full-Round Action</b>: A full-round action consumes all your
              effort during a round. The only movement you can take during a
              full-round action is a 5-foot step before, during, or after the
              action. You can also perform free actions (see below).
            </p>
            <p>
              Some full-round actions do not allow you to take a 5-foot step.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some full-round actions can be taken as standard actions, but only
              in situations when you are limited to performing only a standard
              action during your round. The descriptions of specific actions,
              below, detail which actions allow this option.
            </p>
            <p><a id="free-action"></a>

              <b>Free Action</b>: Free actions consume a very small amount of
              time and effort. You can perform one or more free actions while
              taking another action normally. However, there are reasonable
              limits on what you can really do for free.
            </p>
            <p><a id="not-an-action"></a>
              <b>Not an Action</b>: Some activities are so minor that they are
              not even considered free actions. They literally don�t take any
              time at all to do and are considered an inherent part of doing
              something else.
            </p>
            <p><a id="restricted-activity"></a>
              <b>Restricted Activity</b>: In some situations, you may be unable
              to take a full round�s worth of actions. In such cases, you are
              restricted to taking only a single standard action or a single
              move action (plus free actions as normal). You can�t take a
              full-round action (though you can start or complete a full-round
              action by using a standard action; see below).

              any opponent within 5 feet. (Opponents within 5 feet are
              considered adjacent to you.) Some melee weapons have reach, as
              indicated in their descriptions. With a typical reach weapon, you

              <i>Attacks of Opportunity</i>: Attacking unarmed provokes an
              attack of opportunity from the character you attack, provided she
              is armed. The attack of opportunity comes before your attack. An
              unarmed attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity from other
              foes nor does it provoke an attack of opportunity from an unarmed
              foe.

              An unarmed character can�t take attacks of opportunity (but see

              character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat, a spellcaster
              delivering a touch attack spell, and a creature with natural
              physical weapons all count as being armed. Note that being armed
              counts for both offense and defense (the character can make
              attacks of opportunity)

              critical hit (or �crit�). To find out if it�s a critical hit, you
              immediately make a critical roll � another attack roll with all the
              same modifiers as the attack roll you just made. If the critical
              roll also results in a hit against the target�s AC, your original
              hit is a critical hit. (The critical roll just needs to hit to
              give you a crit. It doesn�t need to come up 20 again.) If the

              A critical hit means that you roll your damage more than once,

              <b>Spell Components</b>: To cast a spell with a verbal (V)
              component, your character must speak in a firm voice. If you�re
              gagged or in the area of a silence spell, you can�t cast such a
              spell. A spellcaster who has been deafened has a 20% chance to
              spoil any spell he tries to cast if that spell has a verbal
              component.
            </p>

            <p>
              To cast a spell with a somatic (S) component, you must gesture
              freely with at least one hand. You can�t cast a spell of this type
              while bound, grappling, or with both your hands full or occupied.
            </p>
            <p>
              To cast a spell with a material (M), focus (F), or divine focus
              (DF) component, you have to have the proper materials, as
              described by the spell. Unless these materials are elaborate
              preparing these materials is a free action. For material
              components and focuses whose costs are not listed, you can assume
              that you have them if you have your spell component pouch.
            </p>
            Some spells have an experience point (XP) component and entail
            an experience point cost to you. No spell can restore the lost XP.
            You cannot spend so much XP that you lose a level, so you cannot
            cast the spell unless you have enough XP to spare. However, you may,
            on gaining enough XP to achieve a new level, immediately spend the
            XP on casting the spell rather than keeping it to advance a level.
            The XP are expended when you cast the spell, whether or not the
            casting succeeds.
            <p><a id="concentration"></a>
              <b>Concentration</b>: You must concentrate to cast a spell. If you
              can�t concentrate you can�t cast a spell. If you start casting a
              spell but something interferes with your concentration you must
              make a Concentration check or lose the spell. The check�s DC
              depends on what is threatening your concentration (see the
              Concentration skill). If you fail, the spell fizzles with no
              effect. If you prepare spells, it is lost from preparation. If you
              cast at will, it counts against your daily limit of spells even
              though you did not cast it successfully.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Concentrating to Maintain a Spell</b>: Some spells require
              continued concentration to keep them going. Concentrating to
              maintain a spell is a standard action that doesn�t provoke an
              attack of opportunity. Anything that could break your
              concentration when casting a spell can keep you from concentrating
              to maintain a spell. If your concentration breaks, the spell ends.

              Concentration check (DC 10 + points of damage taken + spell level)

            <p><a id="touch-spells-in-combat"></a>
              <b>Touch Spells in Combat</b>: Many spells have a range of touch.
              To use these spells, you cast the spell and then touch the
              subject, either in the same round or any time later. In the same
              round that you cast the spell, you may also touch (or attempt to
              touch) the target. You may take your move before casting the
              spell, after touching the target, or between casting the spell and
              touching the target. You can automatically touch one friend or use
              the spell on yourself, but to touch an opponent, you must succeed
              on an attack roll.
            </p>
            <p><a id="touch-attacks"></a>
              <i>Touch Attacks</i>: Touching an opponent with a touch spell is
              considered to be an armed attack and therefore does not provoke
              attacks of opportunity. However, the act of casting a spell does
              provoke an attack of opportunity. Touch attacks come in two types:
              melee touch attacks and ranged touch attacks. You can score
              critical hits with either type of attack. Your opponent�s AC
              against a touch attack does not include any armor bonus, shield
              bonus, or natural armor bonus. His size modifier, Dexterity
              modifier, and deflection bonus (if any) all apply normally.

              <i>Holding the Charge</i>: If you don�t discharge the spell in the
              round when you cast the spell, you can hold the discharge of the
              spell (hold the charge) indefinitely. You can continue to make
              touch attacks round after round. You can touch one friend as a
              standard action or up to six friends as a full-round action. If
              you touch anything or anyone while holding a charge, even
              unintentionally, the spell discharges. If you cast another spell,
              the touch spell dissipates. Alternatively, you may make a normal
              unarmed attack (or an attack with a natural weapon) while holding
              a charge. In this case, you aren�t considered armed and you
              provoke attacks of opportunity as normal for the attack. (If your
              unarmed attack or natural weapon attack doesn�t provoke attacks of
              opportunity, neither does this attack.) If the attack hits, you
              deal normal damage for your unarmed attack or natural weapon and
              the spell discharges. If the attack misses, you are still holding
              the charge.

              Drawing a weapon so that you can use it in combat, or putting it

              If you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you may draw a

              A spell that takes 1 round to cast is a full-round action. It

              A spell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before
              your turn 1 minute later (and for each of those 10 rounds, you are
              casting a spell as a full-round action). These actions must be
              consecutive and uninterrupted, or the spell automatically fails.

              When you begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to cast, you

              one round to just before your turn in the next round (at least).
              If you lose concentration after starting the spell and before it

              feat) than a regular spell. If a spell�s normal casting time is 1
              standard action, casting a metamagic version of the spell is a
              full-round action for a sorcerer or bard. Note that this isn�t the
              same as a spell with a 1-round casting time � the spell takes effect
              in the same round that you begin casting, and you aren�t required
              to continue the invocations, gestures, and concentration until
              your next turn. For spells with a longer casting time, it takes an

              You can move 5 feet in any round when you don�t perform any other
              kind of movement. Taking this 5-foot step never provokes an attack
              of opportunity. You can�t take more than one 5-foot step in a
              round, and you can�t take a 5-foot step in the same round when you
              move any distance.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can take a 5-foot step before, during, or after your other
              actions in the round.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can only take a 5-foot-step if your movement isn�t hampered by
              difficult terrain or darkness. Any creature with a speed of 5 feet
              or less can�t take a 5-foot step, since moving even 5 feet
              requires a move action for such a slow creature.
            </p>
            <p>

              You may not take a 5-foot step using a form of movement for which
              you do not have a listed speed.

              Certain feats let you take special actions in combat. Other feats
              do not require actions themselves, but they give you a bonus when
              attempting something you can already do. Some feats are not meant
              to be used within the framework of combat. The individual feat
              descriptions tell you what you need to know about them.

            <p class="initial">
              Most skill uses are standard actions, but some might be move
              actions, full-round actions, free actions, or something else
              entirely. The individual skill descriptions tell you what sorts of
              actions are required to perform skills.
