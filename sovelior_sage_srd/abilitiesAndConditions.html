            </h5>
            <p class="initial">
              Various attacks cause ability score loss, either ability damage or
              ability drain. Points lost to ability damage return at the rate of
              1 point per day (or double that if the character gets complete bed
              rest) to each damaged ability, and the spells lesser restoration
              and restoration offset ability damage as well. Ability drain,
              however, is permanent, though restoration can restore even those
              lost ability score points.
            </p>
            <p>
              While any loss is debilitating, losing all points in an ability
              score can be devastating.

            <p>
              Keeping track of negative ability score points is never necessary.
              A character&rsquo;s ability score can&rsquo;t drop below 0.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having a score of 0 in an ability is different from having no
              ability score whatsoever.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some spells or abilities impose an effective ability score
              reduction, which is different from ability score loss. Any such
              reduction disappears at the end of the spell&rsquo;s or ability&rsquo;s
              duration, and the ability score immediately returns to its former
              value.
            </p>
            <p>

              If a character&rsquo;s Constitution score drops, then he loses 1 hit
              point per Hit Die for every point by which his Constitution
              modifier drops. A hit point score can&rsquo;t be reduced by Constitution
              damage or drain to less than 1 hit point per Hit Die.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ability that some creatures have to drain ability scores is a
              supernatural one, requiring some sort of attack. Such creatures do
              not drain abilities from enemies when the enemies strike them,
              even with unarmed attacks or natural weapons.

                  antimagic fades, the center of the effect moves away, and so
                  on), the magic returns. Spells that still have part of their
                  duration left begin functioning again, magic items are once

            </h5>
            <p class="initial">
              Some creatures have blindsight, the extraordinary ability to use a
              nonvisual sense (or a combination of such senses) to operate
              effectively without vision. Such sense may include sensitivity to
              vibrations, acute scent, keen hearing, or echolocation. This
              ability makes invisibility and concealment (even magical darkness)
              irrelevant to the creature (though it still can&rsquo;t see ethereal
              creatures). This ability operates out to a range specified in the
              creature description.

            <ul>
              <li>

                <p>
                  Blindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or
                  visual contrast. A creature cannot read with blindsight.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Blindsight does not subject a creature to gaze attacks (even

              <b>Blindsense</b>: Other creatures have blindsense, a lesser
              ability that lets the creature notice things it cannot see, but
              without the precision of blindsight. The creature with blindsense
              usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice and
              locate creatures within range of its blindsense ability, provided
              that it has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the
              creature cannot see has total concealment (50% miss chance)
              against the creature with blindsense, and the blindsensing
              creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that
              have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a
              creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still
              denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from
              creatures it cannot see.

              A creature attacking with a breath weapon is actually expelling
              something from its mouth (rather than conjuring it by means of a
              spell or some other magical effect). Most creatures with breath
              weapons are limited to a number of uses per day or by a minimum
              length of time that must pass between uses. Such creatures are
              usually smart enough to save their breath weapon until they really
              need it.

                  Using a breath weapon is typically a standard action.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  No attack roll is necessary. The breath simply fills its
                  stated area.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Any character caught in the area must make the appropriate
                  saving throw or suffer the breath weapon&rsquo;s full effect. In
                  many cases, a character who succeeds on his saving throw still
                  takes half damage or some other reduced effect.

              CHARM AND COMPULSION
            </h5>
            <p class="initial">
              Many abilities and spells can cloud the minds of characters and
              monsters, leaving them unable to tell friend from foe &mdash; or worse
              yet, deceiving them into thinking that their former friends are
              now their worst enemies. Two general types of enchantments affect
              characters and creatures: charms and compulsions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Charming another creature gives the charming character the ability
              to befriend and suggest courses of actions to his minion, but the
              servitude is not absolute or mindless. Charms of this type include
              the various charm spells. Essentially, a charmed character retains
              free will but makes choices according to a skewed view of the
              world.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A charmed creature doesn&rsquo;t gain any magical ability to
                  understand his new friend&rsquo;s language.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A charmed character retains his original alignment and
                  allegiances, generally with the exception that he now regards
                  the charming creature as a dear friend and will give great
                  weight to his suggestions and directions.
                </p>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A charmed character fights his former allies only if they
                  threaten his new friend, and even then he uses the least
                  lethal means at his disposal as long as these tactics show any
                  possibility of success (just as he would in a fight between
                  two actual friends).
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A charmed character is entitled to an opposed Charisma check
                  against his master in order to resist instructions or commands
                  that would make him do something he wouldn&rsquo;t normally do even
                  for a close friend. If he succeeds, he decides not to go along
                  with that order but remains charmed.
                </p>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A charmed character never obeys a command that is obviously
                  suicidal or grievously harmful to her.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If the charming creature commands his minion to do something
                  that the influenced character would be violently opposed to,
                  the subject may attempt a new saving throw to break free of
                  the influence altogether.
                </p>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A charmed character who is openly attacked by the creature who
                  charmed him or by that creature&rsquo;s apparent allies is
                  automatically freed of the spell or effect.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Compulsion is a different matter altogether. A compulsion
              overrides the subject&rsquo;s free will in some way or simply changes
              the way the subject&rsquo;s mind works. A charm makes the subject a
              friend of the caster; a compulsion makes the subject obey the
              caster.
            </p>

            <p>
              Regardless of whether a character is charmed or compelled, he
              won&rsquo;t volunteer information or tactics that his master doesn&rsquo;t ask
              for.
            </p>
            <h5><a id="cold-immunity"></a>
              COLD IMMUNITY
            </h5>
            <p class="initial">
              A creature with cold immunity never takes cold damage. It has
              vulnerability to fire, which means it takes half again as much
              (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a saving
              throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.
            </p>
            <h5><a id="damage-reduction"></a>
              DAMAGE REDUCTION
            </h5>
            <p class="initial">
              Some magic creatures have the supernatural ability to instantly
              heal damage from weapons or to ignore blows altogether as though
              they were invulnerable.
            </p>
            <p>
              The numerical part of a creature&rsquo;s damage reduction is the amount
              of hit points the creature ignores from normal attacks. Usually, a
              certain type of weapon can overcome this reduction. This
              information is separated from the damage reduction number by a
              slash. Damage reduction may be overcome by special materials, by
              magic weapons (any weapon with a +1 or higher enhancement bonus,
              not counting the enhancement from masterwork quality), certain
              types of weapons (such as slashing or bludgeoning), and weapons
              imbued with an alignment. If a dash follows the slash then the
              damage reduction is effective against any attack that does not
              ignore damage reduction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement
              bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose
              of overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a
              projectile weapon with an alignment gains the alignment of that
              projectile weapon (in addition to any alignment it may already
              have).
            </p>

            <p>
              Whenever damage reduction completely negates the damage from an
              attack, it also negates most special effects that accompany the
              attack, such as injury type poison, a monk&rsquo;s stunning, and injury
              type disease. Damage reduction does not negate touch attacks,
              energy damage dealt along with an attack, or energy drains. Nor
              does it affect poisons or diseases delivered by inhalation,
              ingestion, or contact.
            </p>
            <p>
              Attacks that deal no damage because of the target&rsquo;s damage
              reduction do not disrupt spells.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spells, spell-like abilities, and energy attacks (even nonmagical
              fire) ignore damage reduction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes damage reduction is instant healing. Sometimes damage
              reduction represents the creature&rsquo;s tough hide or body. In either
              case, characters can see that conventional attacks don&rsquo;t work.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a creature has damage reduction from more than one source, the
              two forms of damage reduction do not stack. Instead, the creature
              gets the benefit of the best damage reduction in a given
              situation.
            </p>
            <h5><a id="darkvision"></a>
              DARKVISION
            </h5>
            <p class="initial">
              Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light
              source at all, out to a range specified for the creature.
              Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned).
              It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not
              see otherwise &mdash; invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions
              are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision
              subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of
              light does not spoil darkvision.

            </h5>

              In most cases, a death attack allows the victim a Fortitude save

              Use of the Heal skill can help a diseased character. Every time a

              the healer makes a check. The diseased character can use the
              healer&rsquo;s result in place of his saving throw if the Heal check
              result is higher. The diseased character must be in the healer&rsquo;s

              Characters recover points lost to ability score damage at a rate
              of 1 per day per ability damaged, and this rule applies even while
              a disease is in progress. That means that a character with a minor
              disease might be able to withstand it without accumulating any
              damage.

            <p class="initial">

              Some horrible creatures, especially undead monsters, possess a
              fearsome supernatural ability to drain levels from those they
              strike in combat. The creature making an energy drain attack draws
              a portion of its victim&rsquo;s life force from her. Most energy drain
              attacks require a successful melee attack roll &mdash; mere physical
              contact is not enough. Each successful energy drain attack bestows
              one or more negative levels on the opponent. A creature takes the
              following penalties for each negative level it has gained.

              If the victim casts spells, she loses access to one spell as if
              she had cast her highest-level, currently available spell. (If she
              has more than one spell at her highest level, she chooses which
              she loses.) In addition, when she next prepares spells or regains
              spell slots, she gets one less spell slot at her highest spell
              level.
            </p>
            <p>
              Negative levels remain for 24 hours or until removed with a spell,
              such as restoration. After 24 hours, the afflicted creature must
              attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 attacker&rsquo;s HD + attacker&rsquo;s
              Cha modifier). (The DC is provided in the attacker&rsquo;s description.)
              If the saving throw succeeds, the negative level goes away with no
              harm to the creature. The afflicted creature makes a separate
              saving throw for each negative level it has gained. If the save
              fails, the negative level goes away, but the creature&rsquo;s level is
              also reduced by one.
            </p>
            <p>
              A character with negative levels at least equal to her current
              level, or drained below 1st level, is instantly slain. Depending
              on the creature that killed her, she may rise the next night as a
              monster of that kind. If not, she rises as a wight. A creature
              gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level it bestows
              (though not if the negative level is caused by a spell or similar
              effect).

            <h5><a id="etherealness"></a>
              ETHEREALNESS
            </h5>
            <p class="initial">
              Phase spiders and certain other creatures can exist on the
              Ethereal Plane. While on the Ethereal Plane, a creature is called
              ethereal. Unlike incorporeal creatures, ethereal creatures are not
              present on the Material Plane.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ethereal creatures are invisible, inaudible, insubstantial, and
              scentless to creatures on the Material Plane. Even most magical
              attacks have no effect on them. See invisibility and true seeing
              reveal ethereal creatures.
            </p>
            <p>

              An ethereal creature can see and hear into the Material Plane in a
              60-foot radius, though material objects still block sight and
              sound. (An ethereal creature can&rsquo;t see through a material wall,
              for instance.) An ethereal creature inside an object on the
              Material Plane cannot see. Things on the Material Plane, however,
              look gray, indistinct, and ghostly. An ethereal creature can&rsquo;t
              affect the Material Plane, not even magically. An ethereal
              creature, however, interacts with other ethereal creatures and
              objects the way material creatures interact with material
              creatures and objects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even if a creature on the Material Plane can see an ethereal
              creature the ethereal creature is on another plane. Only force
              effects can affect the ethereal creatures. If, on the other hand,
              both creatures are ethereal, they can affect each other normally.
            </p>
            <p>
              A force effect originating on the Material Plane extends onto the
              Ethereal Plane, so that a wall of force blocks an ethereal
              creature, and a magic missile can strike one (provided the
              spellcaster can see the ethereal target). Gaze effects and
              abjurations also extend from the Material Plane to the Ethereal
              Plane. None of these effects extend from the Ethereal Plane to the
              Material Plane.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ethereal creatures move in any direction (including up or down) at
              will. They do not need to walk on the ground, and material objects
              don&rsquo;t block them (though they can&rsquo;t see while their eyes are
              within solid material).
            </p>

            <p>
              Ghosts have a power called manifestation that allows them to
              appear on the Material Plane as incorporeal creatures. Still, they
              are on the Ethereal Plane, and another ethereal creature can
              interact normally with a manifesting ghost. Ethereal creatures
              pass through and operate in water as easily as air. Ethereal
              creatures do not fall or take falling damage.

            <h5><a id="evasion"></a><a id="evasion-and-improved-evasion"></a>
              EVASION AND IMPROVED EVASION
            </h5>
            <p class="initial">
              These extraordinary abilities allow the target of an area attack
              to leap or twist out of the way. Rogues and monks have evasion and
              improved evasion as class features, but certain other creatures
              have these abilities, too.
            </p>
            <p>

              If subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex save for half
              damage, a character with evasion takes no damage on a successful
              save.
            </p>
            <p>
              As with a Reflex save for any creature, a character must have room
              to move in order to evade. A bound character or one squeezing
              through an area cannot use evasion.
            </p>
            <p>
              As with a Reflex save for any creature, evasion is a reflexive
              ability. The character need not know that the attack is coming to
              use evasion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rogues and monks cannot use evasion in medium or heavy armor. Some
              creatures with the evasion ability as an innate quality do not
              have this limitation.

              Improved evasion is like evasion, except that even on a failed

              FAST HEALING
            </h5>
            <p class="initial">
              A creature with fast healing has the extraordinary ability to
              regain hit points at an exceptional rate. Except for what is noted
              here, fast healing is like natural healing.
            </p>
            <p>

              At the beginning of each of the creature&rsquo;s turns, it heals a
              certain number of hit points (defined in its description).
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike regeneration, fast healing does not allow a creature to
              regrow or reattach lost body parts.
            </p>
            <p>
              A creature that has taken both nonlethal and lethal damage heals
              the nonlethal damage first.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation,
              thirst, or suffocation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Fast healing does not increase the number of hit points regained
              when a creature polymorphs.

            </h5>
            <p class="initial">
              Spells, magic items, and certain monsters can affect characters
              with fear. In most cases, the character makes a Will saving throw
              to resist this effect, and a failed roll means that the character
              is shaken, frightened, or panicked.
            </p>
            <p><a id="fear-shaken"></a>

              <b>Shaken</b>: Characters who are shaken take a &#8211;2 penalty on

            <p><a id="fear-frightened"></a>
              <b>Frightened</b>: Characters who are frightened are shaken, and
              in addition they flee from the source of their fear as quickly as
              they can. They can choose the path of their flight. Other than
              that stipulation, once they are out of sight (or hearing) of the
              source of their fear, they can act as they want. However, if the
              duration of their fear continues, characters can be forced to flee
              once more if the source of their fear presents itself again.
              Characters unable to flee can fight (though they are still
              shaken).

              run away from the source of their fear as quickly as they can.
              Other than running away from the source, their path is random.
              They flee from all other dangers that confront them rather than
              facing those dangers. Panicked characters cower if they are
              prevented from fleeing.

              A creature with fire immunity never takes fire damage. It has

            <p class="initial">
              Some creatures have the supernatural or spell-like ability to take
              the form of a cloud of vapor or gas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Creatures in gaseous form can&rsquo;t run but can fly. A gaseous
              creature can move about and do the things that a cloud of gas can
              conceivably do, such as flow through the crack under a door. It
              can&rsquo;t, however, pass through solid matter. Gaseous creatures can&rsquo;t
              attack physically or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material,
              or focus components. They lose their supernatural abilities
              (except for the supernatural ability to assume gaseous form, of
              course).
            </p>
            <p>
              Creatures in gaseous form have damage reduction 10/magic. Spells,
              spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities affect them
              normally. Creatures in gaseous form lose all benefit of material
              armor (including natural armor), though size, Dexterity,
              deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force armor still
              apply.
            </p>
            <p>

              Gaseous creatures do not need to breathe and are immune to attacks
              involving breathing (troglodyte stench, poison gas, and the like).
            </p>
            <p>
              Gaseous creatures can&rsquo;t enter water or other liquid. They are not
              ethereal or incorporeal. They are affected by winds or other forms
              of moving air to the extent that the wind pushes them in the
              direction the wind is moving. However, even the strongest wind
              can&rsquo;t disperse or damage a creature in gaseous form.
            </p>
            <p>
              Discerning a creature in gaseous form from natural mist requires a
              DC 15 Spot check. Creatures in gaseous form attempting to hide in
              an area with mist, smoke, or other gas gain a +20 bonus.

            <h5><a id="gaze-attacks"></a>
              GAZE ATTACKS
            </h5>

            <p class="initial">
              While the medusa&rsquo;s gaze is well known, gaze attacks can also
              charm, curse, or even kill. Gaze attacks not produced by a spell
              are supernatural.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each character within range of a gaze attack must attempt a saving
              throw (which can be a Fortitude or Will save) each round at the
              beginning of his turn.
            </p>
            <p>
              An opponent can avert his eyes from the creature&rsquo;s face, looking
              at the creature&rsquo;s body, watching its shadow, or tracking the
              creature in a reflective surface. Each round, the opponent has a
              50% chance of not having to make a saving throw. The creature with
              the gaze attack gains concealment relative to the opponent. An
              opponent can shut his eyes, turn his back on the creature, or wear
              a blindfold. In these cases, the opponent does not need to make a
              saving throw. The creature with the gaze attack gains total
              concealment relative to the opponent.
            </p>
            <p>

              A creature with a gaze attack can actively attempt to use its gaze
              as an attack action. The creature simply chooses a target within
              range, and that opponent must attempt a saving throw. If the
              target has chosen to defend against the gaze as discussed above,
              the opponent gets a chance to avoid the saving throw (either 50%
              chance for averting eyes or 100% chance for shutting eyes). It is
              possible for an opponent to save against a creature&rsquo;s gaze twice
              during the same round, once before its own action and once during
              the creature&rsquo;s action.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking at the creature&rsquo;s image (such as in a mirror or as part of
              an illusion) does not subject the viewer to a gaze attack.
            </p>
            <p>
              A creature is immune to its own gaze attack.
            </p>
            <p>
              If visibility is limited (by dim lighting, a fog, or the like) so
              that it results in concealment, there is a percentage chance equal
              to the normal miss chance for that degree of concealment that a
              character won&rsquo;t need to make a saving throw in a given round. This
              chance is not cumulative with the chance for averting your eyes,
              but is rolled separately.
            </p>

            <p>
              Invisible creatures cannot use gaze attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Characters using darkvision in complete darkness are affected by a

            <p>
              Unless specified otherwise, a creature with a gaze attack can
              control its gaze attack and &ldquo;turn it off &rdquo; when so desired.

            <p class="initial">
              Spectres, wraiths, and a few other creatures lack physical bodies.
              Such creatures are insubstantial and cant be touched by
              nonmagical matter or energy. Likewise, they cannot manipulate
              objects or exert physical force on objects. However, incorporeal
              beings have a tangible presence that sometimes seems like a
              physical attack against a corporeal creature.
            </p>
            <p>
              Incorporeal creatures are present on the same plane as the
              characters, and characters have some chance to affect them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Incorporeal creatures can be harmed only by other incorporeal
              creatures, by magic weapons, or by spells, spell-like effects, or
              supernatural effects. They are immune to all nonmagical attack
              forms. They are not burned by normal fires, affected by natural
              cold, or harmed by mundane acids.
            </p>

            <p>
              Even when struck by magic or magic weapons, an incorporeal
              creature has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal
              source &mdash; except for a force effect or damage dealt by a ghost touch
              weapon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Incorporeal creatures are immune to critical hits, extra damage
              from being favored enemies, and from sneak attacks. They move in
              any direction (including up or down) at will. They do not need to
              walk on the ground. They can pass through solid objects at will,
              although they cannot see when their eyes are within solid matter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Incorporeal creatures hiding inside solid objects get a +2
              circumstance bonus on Listen checks, because solid objects carry
              sound well. Pinpointing an opponent from inside a solid object
              uses the same rules as pinpointing invisible opponents (see

            <p>
              The physical attacks of incorporeal creatures ignore material

              Incorporeal creatures do not leave footprints, have no scent, and

              The ability to move about unseen is not foolproof. While they

            <p>
              Invisibility does not, by itself, make a creature immune to

            <p>
              A creature can generally notice the presence of an active
              invisible creature within 30 feet with a DC 20 Spot check. The
              observer gains a hunch that &ldquo;something&rsquo;s there&rdquo; but can&rsquo;t see it
              or target it accurately with an attack. A creature who is holding
              still is very hard to notice (DC 30). An inanimate object, an
              unliving creature holding still, or a completely immobile creature
              is even harder to spot (DC 40). It's practically impossible (+20
              DC) to pinpoint an invisible creature's location with a Spot
              check, and even if a character succeeds on such a check, the
              invisible creature still benefits from total concealment (50% miss
              chance).
            </p>
            <p>
              A creature can use hearing to find an invisible creature. A
              character can make a Listen check for this purpose as a free
              action each round. A Listen check result at least equal to the
              invisible creature's Move Silently check result reveals its
              presence. (A creature with no ranks in Move Silently makes a Move
              Silently check as a Dexterity check to which an armor check
              penalty applies.) A successful check lets a character hear an
              invisible creature &ldquo;over there somewhere.&rdquo; It's practically
              impossible to pinpoint the location of an invisible creature. A
              Listen check that beats the DC by 20 pinpoints the invisible
              creature's location.

              A creature can grope about to find an invisible creature. A
              character can make a touch attack with his hands or a weapon into
              two adjacent 5-foot squares using a standard action. If an
              invisible target is in the designated area, there is a 50% miss
              chance on the touch attack. If successful, the groping character
              deals no damage but has successfully pinpointed the invisible
              creature&rsquo;s current location. (If the invisible creature moves, its
              location, obviously, is once again unknown.)
            </p>
            <p>

              If an invisible creature strikes a character, the character struck
              still knows the location of the creature that struck him (until,
              of course, the invisible creature moves). The only exception is if
              the invisible creature has a reach greater than 5 feet. In this
              case, the struck character knows the general location of the
              creature but has not pinpointed the exact location.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose
              location he has pinpointed, he attacks normally, but the invisible
              creature still benefits from full concealment (and thus a 50% miss
              chance). A particularly large and slow creature might get a
              smaller miss chance.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose
              location he has not pinpointed, have the player choose the space
              where the character will direct the attack. If the invisible
              creature is there, conduct the attack normally. If the enemy&rsquo;s not
              there, roll the miss chance as if it were there, don&rsquo;t let the
              player see the result, and tell him that the character has missed.
              That way the player doesn&rsquo;t know whether the attack missed because
              the enemy&rsquo;s not there or because you successfully rolled the miss
              chance.
            </p>
            <p>
              If an invisible character picks up a visible object, the object
              remains visible. One could coat an invisible object with flour to
              at least keep track of its position (until the flour fell off or
              blew away). An invisible creature can pick up a small visible item
              and hide it on his person (tucked in a pocket or behind a cloak)
              and render it effectively invisible.
            </p>

            <p>
              Invisible creatures leave tracks. They can be tracked normally.
              Footprints in sand, mud, or other soft surfaces can give enemies
              clues to an invisible creature&rsquo;s location.
            </p>
            <p>
              An invisible creature in the water displaces water, revealing its
              location. The invisible creature, however, is still hard to see
              and benefits from concealment.
            </p>
            <p>
              A creature with the scent ability can detect an invisible creature
              as it would a visible one.
            </p>
            <p>

              A creature with the Blind-Fight feat has a better chance to hit an
              invisible creature. Roll the miss chance twice, and he misses only
              if both rolls indicate a miss. (Alternatively, make one 25% miss
              chance roll rather than two 50% miss chance rolls.)
            </p>
            <p>
              A creature with blindsight can attack (and otherwise interact
              with) creatures regardless of invisibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              An invisible burning torch still gives off light, as does an
              invisible object with a light spell (or similar spell) cast upon
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ethereal creatures are invisible. Since ethereal creatures are not
              materially present, Spot checks, Listen checks, Scent,
              Blind-Fight, and blindsight don&rsquo;t help locate them. Incorporeal
              creatures are often invisible. Scent, Blind-Fight, and blindsight
              don&rsquo;t help creatures find or attack invisible, incorporeal
              creatures, but Spot checks and possibly Listen checks can help.
            </p>

            <p>
              Invisible creatures cannot use gaze attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Invisibility does not thwart detect spells.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since some creatures can detect or even see invisible creatures,
              it is helpful to be able to hide even when invisible.

            <p class="initial">
              A character who loses a level instantly loses one Hit Die. The
              character&rsquo;s base attack bonus, base saving throw bonuses, and
              special class abilities are now reduced to the new, lower level.
              Likewise, the character loses any ability score gain, skill ranks,
              and any feat associated with the level (if applicable). If the
              exact ability score or skill ranks increased from a level now lost
              is unknown (or the player has forgotten), lose 1 point from the
              highest ability score or ranks from the highest-ranked skills. If
              a familiar or companion creature has abilities tied to a character
              who has lost a level, the creature&rsquo;s abilities are adjusted to fit
              the character&rsquo;s new level.

            <p class="initial">
              Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive
              to light that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light.
              Low-light vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light
              vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame
              is next to her as a source of light.
            </p>
            <p>
              Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit

            <h5><a id="paralysis"></a>
              PARALYSIS
            </h5>
            <p class="initial">

              Some monsters and spells have the supernatural or spell-like
              ability to paralyze their victims, immobilizing them through
              magical means. (Paralysis from toxins is discussed in the Poison
              section below.)
            </p>
            <p>
              A paralyzed character cannot move, speak, or take any physical
              action. He is rooted to the spot, frozen and helpless. Not even
              friends can move his limbs. He may take purely mental actions,
              such as casting a spell with no components.
            </p>
            <p>
              A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes
              paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can&rsquo;t swim
              and may drown.
            </p>
            <h5><a id="poison"></a>
              POISON
            </h5>

            <p class="initial">
              When a character takes damage from an attack with a poisoned
              weapon, touches an item smeared with contact poison, consumes
              poisoned food or drink, or is otherwise poisoned, he must make a
              Fortitude saving throw. If he fails, he takes the poison&rsquo;s initial
              damage (usually ability damage). Even if he succeeds, he typically
              faces more damage 1 minute later, which he can also avoid with a
              successful Fortitude saving throw.
            </p>
            <p>
              One dose of poison smeared on a weapon or some other object
              affects just a single target. A poisoned weapon or object retains
              its venom until the weapon scores a hit or the object is touched
              (unless the poison is wiped off before a target comes in contact
              with it). Any poison smeared on an object or exposed to the
              elements in any way remains potent until it is touched or used.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although supernatural and spell-like poisons are possible,
              poisonous effects are almost always extraordinary.
            </p>
            <p>

              Poisons can be divided into four basic types according to the
              method by which their effect is delivered, as follows.
            </p>
            <p><a id="contact-poison"></a>
              <b>Contact</b>: Merely touching this type of poison necessitates a
              saving throw. It can be actively delivered via a weapon or a touch
              attack. Even if a creature has sufficient damage reduction to
              avoid taking any damage from the attack, the poison can still
              affect it. A chest or other object can be smeared with contact
              poison as part of a trap.
            </p>
            <p><a id="ingested-poison"></a>
              <b>Ingested</b>: Ingested poisons are virtually impossible to
              utilize in a combat situation. A poisoner could administer a
              potion to an unconscious creature or attempt to dupe someone into
              drinking or eating something poisoned. Assassins and other
              characters tend to use ingested poisons outside of combat.
            </p>
            <p><a id="inhaled-poison"></a>

              <b>Inhaled</b>: Inhaled poisons are usually contained in fragile
              vials or eggshells. They can be thrown as a ranged attack with a
              range increment of 10 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is
              struck hard), the container releases its poison. One dose spreads
              to fill the volume of a 10-foot cube. Each creature within the
              area must make a saving throw. (Holding one&rsquo;s breath is
              ineffective against inhaled poisons; they affect the nasal
              membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.)
            </p>
            <p><a id="injury-poison"></a>
              <b>Injury</b>: This poison must be delivered through a wound. If a
              creature has sufficient damage reduction to avoid taking any
              damage from the attack, the poison does not affect it. Traps that
              cause damage from weapons, needles, and the like sometimes contain
              injury poisons.
            </p>
            <p>
              The characteristics of poisons are summarized on Table: Poisons.
              Terms on the table are defined below.
            </p>
            <p><a id="poison-type"></a>

              <i>Type</i>: The poison&rsquo;s method of delivery (contact, ingested,
              inhaled, or via an injury) and the Fortitude save DC to avoid the
              poison&rsquo;s damage.
            </p>
            <p><a id="poison-initial-damage"></a>
              <i>Initial Damage</i>: The damage the character takes immediately
              upon failing his saving throw against this poison. Ability damage
              is temporary unless marked with an asterisk (*), in which case the
              loss is a permanent drain. Paralysis lasts for 2d6 minutes.
            </p>
            <p><a id="poison-secondary-damage"></a>
              <i>Secondary Damage</i>: The amount of damage the character takes
              1 minute after exposure as a result of the poisoning, if he fails
              a second saving throw. Unconsciousness lasts for 1d3 hours.
              Ability damage marked with an asterisk is permanent drain instead
              of temporary damage.
            </p>
            <p><a id="poison-price"></a>

              <i>Price</i>: The cost of one dose (one vial) of the poison. It is
              not possible to use or apply poison in any quantity smaller than
              one dose. The purchase and possession of poison is always illegal,
              and even in big cities it can be obtained only from specialized,
              less than reputable sources.
            </p>

              Perils of Using Poison
            </h6>
            <p class="initial">
              A character has a 5% chance of exposing himself to a poison
              whenever he applies it to a weapon or otherwise readies it for
              use. Additionally, a character who rolls a natural 1 on an attack
              roll with a poisoned weapon must make a DC 15 Reflex save or
              accidentally poison himself with the weapon.
            </p>
            <h6><a id="poison-immunities"></a>
              Poison Immunities
            </h6>

            <p class="initial">
              Creatures with natural poison attacks are immune to their own
              poison. Nonliving creatures (constructs and undead) and creatures
              without metabolisms (such as elementals) are always immune to
              poison. Oozes, plants, and certain kinds of outsiders are also
              immune to poison, although conceivably special poisons could be
              concocted specifically to harm them.

            <p class="initial">
              Magic can cause creatures and characters to change their
              shapes &mdash; sometimes against their will, but usually to gain an
              advantage. Polymorphed creatures retain their own minds but have
              new physical forms.
            </p>
            <p>
              The polymorph spell defines the general polymorph effect.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unless stated otherwise, creatures can polymorph into forms of the
              same type or into an aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant,
              humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, plant, or
              vermin form. Most spells and abilities that grant the ability to
              polymorph place a cap on the Hit Dice of the form taken.
            </p>
            <p>
              Polymorphed creatures gain the Strength, Dexterity, and
              Constitution of their new forms, as well as size, extraordinary
              special attacks, movement capabilities (to a maximum of 120 feet
              for flying and 60 for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus,
              natural weapons, racial skill bonuses, and other gross physical
              qualities such as appearance and number of limbs. They retain
              their original class and level, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma,
              hit points, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and alignment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Creatures who polymorph keep their worn or held equipment if the
              new form is capable of wearing or holding it.
            </p>
            <p>

              Otherwise, it melds with the new form and ceases to function for
              the duration of the polymorph.

              PSIONICS
            </h5>
            <p class="initial">
              Telepathy, mental combat and psychic powers &mdash; psionics is a catchall
              word that describes special mental abilities possessed by various
              creatures. These are spell-like abilities that a creature
              generates from the power of its mind alone &mdash; no other outside
              magical force or ritual is needed. Each psionic creature&rsquo;s
              description contains details on its psionic abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Psionic attacks almost always allow Will saving throws to resist
              them. However, not all psionic attacks are mental attacks. Some
              psionic abilities allow the psionic creature to reshape its own
              body, heal its wounds, or teleport great distances. Some psionic
              creatures can see into the future, the past, and the present (in
              far-off locales) as well as read the minds of others.

              RAYS
            </h5>
            <p class="initial">
              All ray attacks require the attacker to make a successful ranged
              touch attack against the target. Rays have varying ranges, which
              are simple maximums. A ray&rsquo;s attack roll never takes a range
              penalty. Even if a ray hits, it usually allows the target to make
              a saving throw (Fortitude or Will). Rays never allow a Reflex
              saving throw, but if a character&rsquo;s Dexterity bonus to AC is high,
              it might be hard to hit her with the ray in the first place.

              REGENERATION
            </h5>
            <p class="initial">

              Creatures with this extraordinary ability recover from wounds
              quickly and can even regrow or reattach severed body parts. Damage
              dealt to the creature is treated as nonlethal damage, and the
              creature automatically cures itself of nonlethal damage at a fixed
              rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Certain attack forms, typically fire and acid, deal damage to the
              creature normally; that sort of damage doesn&rsquo;t convert to
              nonlethal damage and so doesn&rsquo;t go away. The creature&rsquo;s
              description includes the details.
            </p>
            <p>
              Creatures with regeneration can regrow lost portions of their
              bodies and can reattach severed limbs or body parts. Severed parts
              die if they are not reattached.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regeneration does not restore hit points lost from starvation,
              thirst, or suffocation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Attack forms that don&rsquo;t deal hit point damage ignore regeneration.
            </p>
            <p>
              An attack that can cause instant death only threatens the creature
              with death if it is delivered by weapons that deal it lethal
              damage.
            </p>
            <h5><a id="resistance-to-energy"></a>
              RESISTANCE TO ENERGY
            </h5>
            <p class="initial">

              A creature with resistance to energy has the ability (usually
              extraordinary) to ignore some damage of a certain type each round,
              but it does not have total immunity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each resistance ability is defined by what energy type it resists
              and how many points of damage are resisted. It doesn&rsquo;t matter
              whether the damage has a mundane or magical source.
            </p>
            <p>
              When resistance completely negates the damage from an energy
              attack, the attack does not disrupt a spell. This resistance does
              not stack with the resistance that a spell might provide.
            </p>
            <h5><a id="scent"></a>
              SCENT
            </h5>

            <p class="initial">
              This extraordinary ability lets a creature detect approaching
              enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.
            </p>
            <p>
              A creature with the scent ability can detect opponents by sense of
              smell, generally within 30 feet. If the opponent is upwind, the
              range is 60 feet. If it is downwind, the range is 15 feet. Strong
              scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice
              the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or
              troglodyte stench, can be detected at three times these ranges.
            </p>
            <p>
              The creature detects another creature&rsquo;s presence but not its
              specific location. Noting the direction of the scent is a move
              action. If it moves within 5 feet of the scent&rsquo;s source, the
              creature can pinpoint that source.
            </p>
            <p>

              A creature with the Track feat and the scent ability can follow
              tracks by smell, making a Wisdom check to find or follow a track.
              The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10. The DC increases or
              decreases depending on how strong the quarry&rsquo;s odor is, the number
              of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the
              trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise
              follows the rules for the Track feat. Creatures tracking by scent
              ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just
              as humans do familiar sights.
            </p>
            <p>
              Water, particularly running water, ruins a trail for air-breathing
              creatures. Water-breathing creatures that have the scent ability,
              however, can use it in the water easily.
            </p>
            <p>
              False, powerful odors can easily mask other scents. The presence
              of such an odor completely spoils the ability to properly detect
              or identify creatures, and the base Survival DC to track becomes
              20 rather than 10.
            </p>
            <h5><a id="spell-resistance"></a>
              SPELL RESISTANCE
            </h5>
            <p class="initial">
              Spell resistance is the extraordinary ability to avoid being
              affected by spells. (Some spells also grant spell resistance.)
            </p>
            <p>
              To affect a creature that has spell resistance, a spellcaster must
              make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) at least equal to
              the creature&rsquo;s spell resistance. (The defender&rsquo;s spell resistance
              is like an Armor Class against magical attacks.) If the caster
              fails the check, the spell doesn&rsquo;t affect the creature. The
              possessor does not have to do anything special to use spell
              resistance. The creature need not even be aware of the threat for
              its spell resistance to operate.
            </p>
            <p>

              Only spells and spell-like abilities are subject to spell
              resistance. Extraordinary and supernatural abilities (including
              enhancement bonuses on magic weapons) are not. A creature can have
              some abilities that are subject to spell resistance and some that
              are not. Even some spells ignore spell resistance; see When Spell
              Resistance Applies, below.
            </p>
            <p>
              A creature can voluntarily lower its spell resistance. Doing so is
              a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
              Once a creature lowers its resistance, it remains down until the
              creatures next turn. At the beginning of the creature&rsquo;s next
              turn, the creature&rsquo;s spell resistance automatically returns unless
              the creature intentionally keeps it down (also a standard action
              that does not provoke an attack of opportunity).
            </p>
            <p>
              A creature&rsquo;s spell resistance never interferes with its own
              spells, items, or abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              A creature with spell resistance cannot impart this power to
              others by touching them or standing in their midst. Only the
              rarest of creatures and a few magic items have the ability to
              bestow spell resistance upon another.
            </p>

            <p>
              Spell resistance does not stack. It overlaps.

            </h6>
            <p class="initial">
              Each spell includes an entry that indicates whether spell
              resistance applies to the spell. In general, whether spell
              resistance applies depends on what the spell does:

            <p>

              <b>Targeted Spells</b>: Spell resistance applies if the spell is
              targeted at the creature. Some individually targeted spells can be
              directed at several creatures simultaneously. In such cases, a
              creature&rsquo;s spell resistance applies only to the portion of the
              spell actually targeted at that creature. If several different
              resistant creatures are subjected to such a spell, each checks its
              spell resistance separately.
            </p>
            <p><a id="spell-resistance-and-area-spells"></a>
              <b>Area Spells</b>: Spell resistance applies if the resistant
              creature is within the spell&rsquo;s area. It protects the resistant
              creature without affecting the spell itself.
            </p>
            <p><a id="spell-resistance-and-effect-spells"></a>
              <b>Effect Spells</b>: Most effect spells summon or create
              something and are not subject to spell resistance. Sometimes,
              however, spell resistance applies to effect spells, usually to
              those that act upon a creature more or less directly, such as web.
            </p>
            <p>

              Spell resistance can protect a creature from a spell that&rsquo;s
              already been cast. Check spell resistance when the creature is
              first affected by the spell.
            </p>
            <p>
              Check spell resistance only once for any particular casting of a
              spell or use of a spell-like ability. If spell resistance fails
              the first time, it fails each time the creature encounters that
              same casting of the spell. Likewise, if the spell resistance
              succeeds the first time, it always succeeds. If the creature has
              voluntarily lowered its spell resistance and is then subjected to
              a spell, the creature still has a single chance to resist that
              spell later, when its spell resistance is up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spell resistance has no effect unless the energy created or
              released by the spell actually goes to work on the resistant
              creature&rsquo;s mind or body. If the spell acts on anything else and
              the creature is affected as a consequence, no roll is required.
              Creatures can be harmed by a spell without being directly
              affected.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spell resistance does not apply if an effect fools the creature&rsquo;s
              senses or reveals something about the creature.
            </p>

            <p>
              Magic actually has to be working for spell resistance to apply.
              Spells that have instantaneous durations but lasting results
              aren&rsquo;t subject to spell resistance unless the resistant creature
              is exposed to the spell the instant it is cast.
            </p>
            <p>
              When in doubt about whether a spell&rsquo;s effect is direct or
              indirect, consider the spell&rsquo;s school:

            <p><a id="spell-resistance-and-abjuration"></a>
              <b>Abjuration</b>: The target creature must be harmed, changed, or
              restricted in some manner for spell resistance to apply.
              Perception changes aren&rsquo;t subject to spell resistance.
            </p>
            <p>

              Abjurations that block or negate attacks are not subject to an
              attacker&rsquo;s spell resistance &mdash; it is the protected creature that is
              affected by the spell (becoming immune or resistant to the
              attack).
            </p>
            <p><a id="spell-resistance-and-conjuration"></a>
              <b>Conjuration</b>: These spells are usually not subject to spell
              resistance unless the spell conjures some form of energy. Spells
              that summon creatures or produce effects that function like
              creatures are not subject to spell resistance.
            </p>
            <p><a id="spell-resistance-and-divination"></a>
              <b>Divination</b>: These spells do not affect creatures directly
              and are not subject to spell resistance, even though what they
              reveal about a creature might be very damaging.
            </p>
            <p><a id="spell-resistance-and-enchantment"></a>

              <b>Enchantment</b>: Since enchantment spells affect creatures&rsquo;
              minds, they are typically subject to spell resistance.
            </p>
            <p><a id="spell-resistance-and-evocation"></a>
              <b>Evocation</b>: If an evocation spell deals damage to the
              creature, it has a direct effect. If the spell damages something
              else, it has an indirect effect.
            </p>
            <p><a id="spell-resistance-and-illusion"></a>
              <b>Illusion</b>: These spells are almost never subject to spell

            <p><a id="spell-resistance-and-necromancy"></a>

              <b>Necromancy</b>: Most of these spells alter the target
              creature&rsquo;s life force and are subject to spell resistance. Unusual
              necromancy spells that don&rsquo;t affect other creatures directly are
              not subject to spell resistance.
            </p>
            <p><a id="spell-resistance-and-transmutation"></a>
              <b>Transmutation</b>: These spells are subject to spell resistance
              if they transform the target creature. Transmutation spells are
              not subject to spell resistance if they are targeted on a point in
              space instead of on a creature. Some transmutations make objects
              harmful (or more harmful), such as magic stone. Even these spells
              are not generally subject to spell resistance because they affect
              the objects, not the creatures against which the objects are used.
              Spell resistance works against magic stone only if the creature
              with spell resistance is holding the stones when the cleric casts
              magic stone on them.

              Successful Spell Resistance
            </h6>
            <p class="initial">

              Spell resistance prevents a spell or a spell-like ability from
              affecting or harming the resistant creature, but it never removes
              a magical effect from another creature or negates a spell&rsquo;s effect
              on another creature. Spell resistance prevents a spell from
              disrupting another spell.
            </p>
            <p>
              Against an ongoing spell that has already been cast, a failed
              check against spell resistance allows the resistant creature to
              ignore any effect the spell might have. The magic continues to
              affect others normally.

              A creature with tremorsense automatically senses the location of

            </p>

            <p>
              If no straight path exists through the ground from the creature to
              those that it&rsquo;s sensing, then the range defines the maximum
              distance of the shortest indirect path. It must itself be in
              contact with the ground, and the creatures must be moving.
            </p>
            <p>
              As long as the other creatures are taking physical actions,
              including casting spells with somatic components, they&rsquo;re
              considered moving; they don&rsquo;t have to move from place to place for
              a creature with tremorsense to detect them.
