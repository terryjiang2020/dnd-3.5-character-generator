      <p>The subject can tread on air as if walking on solid ground.
Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or
downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the
air walker&rsquo;s normal speed.</p>
      <p>A strong wind (21+ mph) can push the subject along or hold it
back. At the end of its turn each round, the wind blows the air walker
5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature may be
subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent
winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from
being buffeted about.</p>
      <p>Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still
aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per
round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time,
it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6
points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell
effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the air
walk spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.</p>
      <p>You can cast air walk on a specially trained mount so it can
be ridden through the air. You can train a mount to move with the aid

      <p>You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your
normal form. The new form must be within one size category of your
normal size. The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to your caster
level, to a maximum of 5 HD at 5th level. You can change into a member
of your own kind or even into yourself.</p>
      <p>You retain your own ability scores. Your class and level, hit
points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain
the same. You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks
and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body
part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath
weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).</p>
      <p>You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities
derived from class levels, but you lose any from your normal form that
are not derived from class levels.</p>
      <p>If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate
normally. You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original
form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is,
speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable
of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.</p>
      <p>You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while
retaining your own mind. Physical qualities include natural size,
mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking,
swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for
flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural
weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial
bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of
wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs
does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous
two-weapon attacks) than normal.</p>
      <p>You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special
qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision,
low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration,
scent, and so forth.</p>
      <p>You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special
qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form. Your creature type
and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form. You
cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that
template doesn&rsquo;t change the creature type or subtype.</p>
      <p>You can freely designate the new form&rsquo;s minor physical
qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the
normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form&rsquo;s
significant
physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under
your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new
form&rsquo;s
kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new
form&rsquo;s race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get
a +10
bonus on your <a href="skillsAll.html#disguise"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Disguise</a> check.</p>
      <p>When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains
worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding
the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When
you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the
new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously
occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the
assumed form and can&rsquo;t wear in your normal form fall off and land
at
your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body
part common to both forms at the time of reversion are still held in
the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is
separated from the whole reverts to its true form.</p>

available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum

      <p>Reduce the maximum length by 50% for every additional inch of
thickness, and increase it by 50% for each reduction of the
rope&rsquo;s

&ldquo;coil and knot,&rdquo; &ldquo;loop,&rdquo; &ldquo;loop and

      <p>The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot
of it&mdash;it does not snake outward&mdash;so it must be thrown near
the intended
target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range
increment 10 feet). A typical 1- inch-diameter hempen rope has 2 hit
points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst it. The
rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to
cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become <a

      <p>An <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#invisible"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">invisible</a> barrier surrounds you
and moves with you. The
space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects,
including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities.
Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells
within its confines.</p>
      <p>An antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used
within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it.
Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed
spell&rsquo;s duration.</p>
      <p>Summoned creatures of any type and <a
 href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#incorporeal"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">incorporeal</a> undead wink out
if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once
the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the
duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you
cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that
has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster
level) against the creature&rsquo;s spell resistance to make it wink
out.
(The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an
antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect,
only its result.)</p>
      <p>A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles.
Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the
area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell
has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic
during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting
(unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like
any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and
outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These
creatures&rsquo;
spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily
nullified by the field. Dispel magic does not remove the field.</p>
      <p>Two or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space
have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force,
prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic
field (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities
are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. </p>
      <p>Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the
barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by
the field.</p>

      <p>By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell
allows you to project an astral body onto another plane altogether.</p>
      <p>You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with
you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at
the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you
and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during
the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.</p>
      <p>You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving
your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended
animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or
carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other
planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you
will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical
body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.</p>
      <p>While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is
connected at all times to your physical body by a silvery cord. If the
cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very
few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a
different plane, the <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#incorporeal"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">incorporeal</a> silvery cord remains
invisibly
attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is
slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the
Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended
animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the
Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the
Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.</p>
      <p>You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane
indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended
animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell
lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some
outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body
or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction
of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).</p>

      <p>This spell removes the burden of evil acts or misdeeds from
the subject. The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and
desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature
committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion,
atonement operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of
a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and
willful nature, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to
expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject&rsquo;s burden. Many
casters
first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see geas/quest) or similar
penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before
casting the atonement spell on its behalf.</p>
      <p>Atonement may be cast for one of several purposes, depending
on the version selected.</p>
      <p><i>Reverse Magical Alignment Change</i>: If a creature has had
its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its
original status at no cost in experience points.</p>
      <p><i>Restore Class</i>: A paladin who has lost her class
features due to committing an evil act may have her paladinhood
restored to her by this spell.</p>
      <p><i>Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers</i>: A cleric or druid
who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of his
or her deity may regain that ability by seeking atonement from another
cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was
intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP for his intercession. If
the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose XP.</p>
      <p><i>Redemption or Temptation</i>: You may cast this spell upon
a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to
change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be
present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell,
the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or
acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress,
compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take
advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its
old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any
creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.</p>
      <p>Though the spell description refers to evil acts, atonement
can also be used on any creature that has performed acts against its
alignment, whether those acts are evil, good, chaotic, or lawful.</p>
      <p><i>Note</i>: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player.
This use of atonement simply offers a believable way for a character to
change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.</p>
      <p><i>Material Component</i>: Burning incense.</p>
      <p><i>Focus</i>: In addition to your holy symbol or normal divine
focus, you need a set of prayer beads (or other prayer device, such as
a prayer wheel or prayer book) worth at least 500 gp.</p>

      <p>An augury can tell you whether a particular action will bring
good or bad results for you in the immediate future.</p>
      <p>The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1%
per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; this roll is made secretly. A
question may be so straightforward that a successful result is
automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury
succeeds, you get one of four results:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Woe (for bad results).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Weal and woe (for both).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Nothing (for actions that don&rsquo;t have especially good
or
bad results).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the spell fails, you get the &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; result.
A cleric who
gets the &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; result has no way to tell whether it was
the
consequence of a failed or successful augury.</p>
      <p>The augury can see into the future only about half an hour, so
anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus,
the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a
contemplated action. All auguries cast by the same person about the
same topic use the same dice result as the first casting.</p>

      <p>You change the subject into a Small or smaller animal of

<ul><li><p>The target retains its own alignment (and

writing in some manner (such as drawing in the
dirt with a paw).</p></li></ul>
<p>With those exceptions, the target�s normal
game statistics are replaced by those of the new

has in its normal form, including its class

<p>All items worn or carried by the subject fall to
the ground at its feet, even if they could be worn
or carried by the new form.</p>
<p>If the new form would prove fatal to the
creature (for example, if you polymorphed a
landbound target into a fish, or an airborne
target into a toad), the subject gets a +4 bonus
on the save.</p>
<p>If the subject remains in the new form for 24
consecutive hours, it must attempt a Will save.
If this save fails, it loses its ability to understand
language, as well as all other memories of its
previous form, and its Hit Dice and hit points
change to match an average creature of its new
form. These abilities and statistics return to
normal if the effect is later ended.</p>
<p>Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune
to baleful polymorph, and a creature with the

      <p>A binding spell creates a magical restraint to hold a
creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice
equal at least one-half your caster level.</p>
      <p>You may have as many as six assistants help you with the
spell. For each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level for
this casting of binding increases by 1. For each assistant who casts
dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your caster
level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to
one-third of that assistant&rsquo;s level, provided that the
spell&rsquo;s target
is appropriate for a binding spell. Since the assistants&rsquo; spells
are
cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding
spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants&rsquo;
spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target
gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All
binding spells are dismissible.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify
triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature
whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as
you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood
of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature&rsquo;s
name,
identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable
actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or
hit points don&rsquo;t qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering
conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the
save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.</p>
      <p>If you are casting any of the first three versions of binding
(those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells
to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the
target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell&rsquo;s
duration,
even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving
throw. If the creature succeeds on this save, all the binding spells it
has received are broken.</p>
      <p>The binding spell has six versions. Choose one of the
following versions when you cast the spell.</p>
      <p><i>Chaining</i>: The subject is confined by restraints that
generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the
subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster level. The
subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied
when it received the spell.</p>
      <p><i>Slumber</i>: This version causes the subject to become
comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not
need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of
binding is more difficult to cast than chaining, making it slightly
easier to resist. Reduce the spell&rsquo;s save DC by 1.</p>
      <p><i>Bound Slumber</i>: This combination of chaining and slumber
lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by
2.</p>
      <p><i>Hedged Prison</i>: The subject is transported to or
otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by
any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3.</p>
      <p><i>Metamorphosis</i>: The subject assumes gaseous form, except
for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container,
which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware
of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container,
attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The binding is
permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while
metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.</p>
      <p><i>Minimus Containment</i>: The subject is shrunk to a height
of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar
object. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe,
eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.</p>
      <p>You can&rsquo;t dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a
similar effect, though an antimagic field or Mage&rsquo;s disjunction
affects
it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its
home plane due to dismissal, banishment, or a similar effect.</p>
      <p><i>Components</i>: The components for a binding spell vary
according to the version of the spell, but they always include a
continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or spellbook page
containing the spell, somatic gestures, and materials appropriate to
the form of binding used. These components can include such items as
miniature chains of special metals, soporific herbs of the rarest sort
(for slumber bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the like.</p>
      <p>In addition to the specially made props suited to the specific
type of binding (cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least
500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved
statuette of the subject to be captured.</p>

Treat the
tentacles attacking a particular target as a Large creature with a base

tentacles are immune to all types of damage.</p>

bludgeoning damage. The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until
the spell ends or the opponent escapes.</p>

      <p>The effects are cumulative and concurrent.</p>
      <p>No saving throw is allowed against these effects.</p>
      <p><i>Dazed</i>: The creature can take no actions for 1 round,
though it defends itself normally.</p>
      <p><i>Weakened</i>: The creature&rsquo;s Strength score decreases
by
2d6 points for 2d4 rounds.</p>
      <p><i>Paralyzed</i>: The creature is paralyzed and <a

      <p><i>Killed</i>: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are
destroyed.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this
spell, nonevil extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly
banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return
for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether
the creatures hear the blasphemy. The banishment effect allows a Will
save (at a &ndash;4 penalty) to negate.</p>
      <p>Creatures whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level are
unaffected by blasphemy.</p>

      <p>This transmutation makes a weapon strike true against evil
foes. The weapon is treated as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the
purpose of bypassing the <a style="color: #579eb6" href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#damage-reduction">damage reduction</a> of evil creatures or striking
evil <a href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#incorporeal"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">incorporeal</a> creatures (though
the spell doesn&rsquo;t grant an actual
enhancement bonus). The weapon also becomes good, which means it can
bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures. (This effect
overrides and suppresses any other alignment the weapon might have.)
Individual arrows or bolts can be transmuted, but affected projectile
weapons (such as bows) don&rsquo;t confer the benefit to the
projectiles they
shoot.</p>
      <p>In addition, all critical hit rolls against evil foes are
automatically successful, so every threat is a critical hit. This last
effect does not apply to any weapon that already has a magical effect
related to critical hits, such as a keen weapon or a vorpal sword.</p>

      <p>You &ldquo;blink&rdquo; back and forth between the Material
Plane and the
Ethereal Plane. You look as though you&rsquo;re winking in and out of
reality
very quickly and at random.</p>
      <p>Blinking has several effects, as follows.</p>
      <p>Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the <a
 href="featsAll.html#blind-fight" style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">Blind-Fight</a>
feat doesn&rsquo;t help
opponents, since you&rsquo;re ethereal and not
merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal
creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).</p>
      <p>If the attacker can see <a
 href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#invisible"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">invisible</a> creatures, the miss
chance
is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal
creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a
20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about
to strike.</p>
      <p>Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail
against you while you&rsquo;re blinking unless your attacker can target
invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to
activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not
affect the Material Plane.</p>
      <p>While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks
(but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You
strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls),
denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>
      <p>You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only
while you are material.</p>
      <p>While blinking, you can step through (but not see through)
solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through,
there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are
shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per
5 feet so traveled. You can move at only three-quarters speed (because
movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about
half your time there and half your time material.)</p>
      <p>Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane,
you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with
ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.</p>
      <p>An ethereal creature is invisible, <a
 href="abilitiesAndConditions.html#incorporeal"
 style="color: rgb(87, 158, 182);">incorporeal</a>, and capable of
moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature,
you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.</p>
      <p>An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but
everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the
Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.</p>
      <p>Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their
effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not
vice versa. An ethereal creature can&rsquo;t attack material creatures,
and
spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things.
Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work
on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as
material.</p>

      <p>The subject&rsquo;s outline appears blurred, shifting and
wavering.
This distortion grants the subject concealment (20% miss chance).</p>
      <p>A see invisibility spell does not counteract the blur effect,
but a true seeing spell does.</p>
      <p>Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell&rsquo;s
effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its
own).</p>

      <p>This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations,
and curses. Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect.
For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster
level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect.
Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect.
For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.</p>
      <p>If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by dispel magic,
break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower. </p>
      <p>If the effect comes from some permanent magic item break
enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees
the victim from the item&rsquo;s effects. </p>
