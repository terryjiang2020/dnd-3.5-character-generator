      <a id="amulet-of-health"></a><p><b>Amulet of Health</b>: This amulet is a golden disk on a
chain. It usually bears the image of a lion or other powerful animal.
The amulet grants the wearer an enhancement bonus to Constitution of
+2, +4, or +6.</p>

enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on attack and damage rolls with unarmed
attacks and natural weapons.</p>
      <p>Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, greater magic
fang, creator&rsquo;s caster level must be at least three times the
amulet&rsquo;s
bonus; Price 6,000 gp (+1), 24,000 gp (+2), 54,000 gp (+3), 96,000 gp
(+4), 150,000 gp (+5).</p>
      <a id="amulet-of-natural-armor"></a><p><b>Amulet of Natural Armor</b>: This amulet, usually crafted
from bone or beast scales, toughens the wearer&rsquo;s body and flesh,
giving
him an enhancement bonus to his natural armor bonus of from +1 to +5,
depending on the kind of amulet.</p>
      <p>Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, barkskin,
creator&rsquo;s caster level must be at least three times the
amulet&rsquo;s bonus;
Price 2,000 gp (+1), 8,000 gp (+2), 18,000 gp (+3), 32,000 gp (+4), or
50,000 gp (+5).</p>
      <a id="amulet-of-the-planes"></a><p><b>Amulet of the Planes</b>: This device usually appears to be
a black circular amulet, although any character looking closely at it
sees a dark, moving swirl of color. The amulet allows its wearer to
utilize plane shift. However, this is a difficult item to master. The
user must make a DC 15 Intelligence check in order to get the amulet to
take her to the plane (and the specific location on that plane) that
she wants. If she fails, the amulet transports her and all those
traveling with her to a random location on that plane (01&ndash;60 on
d%) or
to a random plane (61&ndash;100).</p>
      <p>Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, plane shift;
Price 120,000 gp.</p>
      <a id="amulet-of-proof-against-detection-and-location"></a><p><b>Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location</b>: This
silver amulet protects the wearer from scrying and magical location
just as a nondetection spell does. If a divination spell is attempted
against the wearer, the caster of the divination must succeed on a
caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 19 (as if the
caster had cast nondetection on herself ).</p>
      <p>Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item,
nondetection; Price 35,000 gp.</p>
      <a id="apparatus-of-the-crab"></a><p><b>Apparatus of the Crab</b>: This item appears to be a large,
sealed iron barrel, but it has a secret catch (Search DC 20 to locate)
that opens a hatch in one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds ten
(unlabeled) levers: The device has the following characteristics: hp
200; hardness 15; Spd 20 ft., swim 20 ft.; AC 20 (&ndash;1 size, +11

      <p>Operating a lever is a full-round action, and no lever may be
operated more than once per round. However, since two Medium characters
can fit inside, the apparatus can move and attack in the same round.
The device can function in water up to 900 feet deep. It holds enough
air for a crew of two to survive 1d4+1 hours (twice as long for a
single occupant). When activated, the apparatus looks something like a
giant lobster.</p>

      <p>If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from
inside or outside), the bag ruptures and is ruined. All contents are
lost forever. If a bag of holding is turned inside out, its contents
spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be
used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can
survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate.
Retrieving a specific item from a bag of holding is a move
action&mdash;unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack
would
hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action.</p>
      <p>If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole a rift to
the Astral Plane is torn in the space: Bag and hole alike are sucked
into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a
bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: The hole, the bag,
and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying
the portable hole and bag of holding in the process.</p>

      <a id="bag-of-tricks"></a><p><b>Bag of Tricks</b>: This small sack appears normal and
empty. However, anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball.
If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an
animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10
minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point
it disappears. It can follow any of the commands described in the
Handle Animal skill. Each of the three kinds of a bag of tricks
produces a different set of animals. Use the following tables to
determine what animals can be drawn out of each.</p>
      <p>The heavy warhorse appears with harness and tack and accepts
the character who drew it from the bag as a rider.</p>
      <p>Animals produced are always random, and only one may exist at
a time. Up to ten animals can be drawn from the bag each week.</p>

      <p>It functions like a resilient sphere spell (Reflex DC 16

its subject for the spell&rsquo;s duration. The sphere is not subject
to

negation, disintegrate, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects
destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass
through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe
normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be physically
moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.</p>

cloak or in bat form, can be accomplished only in darkness (either
under the night sky or in a lightless or near-lightless environment
underground). Either of the flying powers is usable for up to 7 minutes
at a time, but after a flight of any duration the cloak cannot bestow
any flying power for a like period of time.</p>

of the manta ray adheres to the individual, and he appears nearly
identical to a manta ray (as the polymorph spell, except that it allows
only manta ray form). He gains a +3 natural armor bonus, the ability to
breathe underwater, and a swim speed of 60 feet, like a real manta ray.</p>
      <p>Although the cloak does not enable the wearer to bite
opponents as a manta ray does, it does have a tail spine that can be
used to strike at opponents behind the wearer, dealing 1d6 points of

character has, using his highest melee attack bonus. The wearer can
release his arms from the cloak without sacrificing underwater movement

possessor to put up a special wall of force 10 feet on a side around

impervious to the attack forms mentioned on the table below. The cube
has 36 charges, which are renewed each day. The possessor presses one
face of the cube to activate a particular type of screen or to
deactivate the device. Each effect costs a certain number of charges to
maintain for every minute (or portion of a minute) it is in operation.
Also, when an effect is active, the possessor&rsquo;s speed is limited
to the
maximum value given on the table.</p>
      <p>When the cube of force is active, attacks dealing more than 30
points of damage drain 1 charge for every 10 points of damage beyond 30
that they deal. Spells that affect the integrity of the screen also
drain extra charges. These spells (given in the list below) cannot be

(hemispheres about 1-1/2 feet in diameter on stands). They come in
pairs and are unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are
sounded, all creatures within 120 feet (with the exception of those

very fine, very light metallic dust. A single handful of this substance
flung into the air coats objects within a 10-foot radius, making them
visible even if they are invisible. It likewise negates the effects of
blur and displacement. (In this, it works just like the faerie fire
spell). The dust also reveals figments, mirror images, and projected
images for what they are. A creature coated with the dust takes a

      <a id="dust-of-disappearance"></a><p><b>Dust of Disappearance</b>: This dust looks just like dust
of appearance and is typically stored in the same manner. A creature or
object touched by it becomes invisible (as greater invisibility).
Normal vision can&rsquo;t see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they
be
detected by magical means, including see invisibility or invisibility
purge. Dust of appearance, however, does reveal people and objects made
invisible by dust of disappearance. Other factors, such as sound and
smell, also allow possible detection.</p>

      <a id="dust-of-dryness"></a><p><b>Dust of Dryness</b>: This special dust has many uses. If it
is thrown into water, a volume of as much as 100 gallons is instantly
transformed to nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble-sized pellet,
floating or resting where it was thrown. If this pellet is hurled down,
it breaks and releases the same volume of water. The dust affects only
water (fresh, salt, alkaline), not other liquids.</p>
      <p>If the dust is employed against an elemental with the water
subtype, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be destroyed.
The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to the creature even if its saving
throw succeeds.</p>

changes color and form. Put dust of illusion on a creature, and that
creature is affected as if by a disguise self glamer, with the
individual who sprinkles the dust envisioning the illusion desired. An

actually a magic powder that can conceal the passage of its possessor
and his companions. Tossing a handful of this dust into the air causes
a chamber of up to 100 square feet of floor space to become as dusty,
dirty, and cobweb-laden as if it had been abandoned and disused for a
decade.</p>
      <p>A handful of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of
the passage of as many as a dozen men and horses to be obliterated for
250 feet back into the distance. The results of the dust are
instantaneous, and no magical aura lingers afterward from this use of
the dust. Survival checks made to track a quarry across an area

container capable of holding about twenty arrows. It has three distinct
portions, each with a nondimensional space allowing it to store far
more than would normally be possible. The first and smallest one can
contain up to sixty objects of the same general size and shape as an
arrow. The second slightly longer compartment holds up to eighteen
objects of the same general size and shape as a javelin. The third and
longest portion of the case contains as many as six objects of the same
general size and shape as a bow (spears, staffs, or the like). Once the
owner has filled it, the quiver can produce any item she wishes, as if
from a regular quiver or scabbard. The efficient quiver weighs the same

brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals. A thin
stream of smoke is often seen issuing from it. The bottle can be opened
once per day. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from
the bottle instantly. There is a 10% chance (01&ndash;10 on d%) that
the
efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being released. There is
also a 10% chance (91&ndash;100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants
three
wishes. In either case, the efreeti afterward disappears forever. The
other 80% of the time (11&ndash;90), the inhabitant of the bottle
loyally
serves the character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until the
efreeti&rsquo;s death), doing as she commands. Roll each day the bottle

      <a id="eversmoking-bottle"></a><p><b>Eversmoking Bottle</b>: This metal urn is identical in
appearance to an efreeti bottle, except that it does nothing but smoke.
The amount of smoke is great if the stopper is pulled out, pouring from
the bottle and totally obscuring vision across a 50-foot spread in 1
round. If the bottle is left unstoppered, the smoke billows out another
10 feet per round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area
remains smoke-filled until the eversmoking bottle is stoppered. The
bottle must be resealed by a command word, after which the smoke
dissipates normally. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the smoke in 4
rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the smoke in 1 round.</p>

round) as a gaze attack, except that the wearer must take a standard
action, and those merely looking at the wearer are not affected. Those
failing a DC 11 Will save are affected as by the doom spell. If the
wearer has only one lens, the DC of the saving throw is reduced to 10.
However, if the wearer has both lenses, he gains the additional power
of a continual deathwatch effect and can use fear (Will DC 16 partial)
as a normal gaze attack once per week.</p>

Thereafter, the wearer can use the single lens without being stunned so
long as she covers her other eye. Of course, she can remove the single
lens and see normally at any time, or wear both lenses to end or avoid

      <a id="figurines-of-wondrous-power"></a><p><b>Figurines of Wondrous Power</b>: Each of the several kinds
of figurines of wondrous power appears to be a miniature statuette of a
creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is
tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living
creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The
creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the
creature understands Common but does not speak.</p>
      <p>If a figurine of wondrous power is broken or destroyed in its
statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power
departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a
statuette that can be used again at a later time.</p>
      <a id="figurines-of-wondrous-power-bronze-griffon"></a><p><i>Bronze Griffon</i>: When animated, a bronze griffon acts in
all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor. The

have passed or when the command word is spoken, the bronze griffon once
again becomes a tiny statuette.</p>

pony and has all the statistics of a hippogriff but can make no
attacks. The item can be used three times per week for up to 12 hours
per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken,
the ebony fly again becomes a tiny statuette.</p>

      <a id="figurines-of-wondrous-power-golden-lions"></a><p><i>Golden Lions</i>: These figurines come in pairs. They
become normal adult male lions. If slain in combat, the lions cannot be
brought back from statuette form for one full week. Otherwise, they can
be used once per day for up to 1 hour. They enlarge and shrink upon
speaking the command word.</p>

      <a id="figurines-of-wondrous-power-ivory-goats"></a><p><i>Ivory Goats</i>: These figurines come in threes. Each goat
of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a
different function:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>The Goat of Traveling</i>: This statuette provides a
speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse in every way
except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of one day each
week&mdash;continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24
hours.
At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its
statuette form for not less than one day before it can again be used.</li>
        <li><i>The Goat of Travail</i>: This statuette becomes an
enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a
nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of
exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to
attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each
successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once
per month for up to 12 hours at a time.</li>
        <li><i>The Goat of Terror</i>: When called upon with the proper
command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount, with the
statistics of a light warhorse. However, its rider can employ the
goat&rsquo;s horns as weapons (one horn as a +3 heavy lance, the other
as a
+5 longsword). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat
of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16
partial). It can be used once every two weeks for up to 3 hours per use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate

      <a id="figurines-of-wondrous-power-marble-elephant"></a><p><i>Marble Elephant</i>: This is the largest of the figurines,
the statuette being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of
the command word, a marble elephant grows to the size and
specifications of a true elephant. The animal created from the
statuette is fully obedient to the figurine&rsquo;s owner, serving as a
beast
of burden, a mount, or a combatant. The statuette can be used four
times per month for up to 24 hours at a time.</p>
      <p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate

      <a id="figurines-of-wondrous-power-obsidian-steed"></a><p><i>Obsidian Steed</i>: This figurine appears to be a small,
shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it
vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless
piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy
warhorse with the following additional powers usable once per round at
will: overland flight, plane shift, and ethereal jaunt. The steed
allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the
steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then
return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week
for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian
steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow
suit. Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means.</p>
      <p>Strong conjuration and transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous
Item, animate objects, etherealness, fly, plane shift; Price 28,500 gp.</p>
      <a id="figurines-of-wondrous-power-onyx-dog"></a><p><i>Onyx Dog</i>: When commanded, this statuette changes into a
creature with the same properties as a riding dog except that it is
endowed with an Intelligence of 8, can communicate in Common, and has
exceptional olfactory and visual abilities. (It has the scent ability
and adds +4 to its Spot and Search checks.) It has 60-foot darkvision,
and it can see invisibility. An onyx dog can be used once per week for
up to 6 hours. It obeys only its owner.</p>

      <a id="figurines-of-wondrous-power-serpentine-owl"></a><p><i>Serpentine Owl</i>: This figurine becomes either a
normal-sized horned owl or a giant owl according to the command word
used. The transformation can take place once per day, with a maximum
duration of 8 continuous hours. However, after three transformations
into giant owl form, the statuette loses all its magical properties.
The owl communicates with its owner by telepathic means, informing her
of all it sees and hears. (Remember the limitations of its
Intelligence.)</p>
      <p>Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate
objects; Price 9,100 gp.</p>
      <a id="figurines-of-wondrous-power-silver-raven"></a><p><i>Silver Raven</i>: This silver figurine turns into a raven
on command (but it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it
hardness 10). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a
message just like a creature affected by an animal messenger spell. If
not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its
owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities. It
can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week, but the
duration need not be continuous.</p>

Item, animal messenger, animate objects; Price 3,800 gp.</p>
      <a id="feather-token"></a><p><b>Feather Token</b>: Each of these items is a small feather
that has a power to suit a special need. The kinds of tokens are

to render it immobile for up to one day.</p>
      <a id="feather-token-bird"></a><p><i>Bird</i>: A token that can be used to deliver a small
written message unerringly to a designated target as would a carrier
pigeon. The token lasts as long as it takes to carry the message.</p>
      <a id="feather-token-fan"></a><p><i>Fan</i>: A token that forms a huge flapping fan, causing a
breeze of sufficient strength to propel one ship (about 25 mph). This
wind is not cumulative with existing wind speed. The token can,
however, be used to lessen existing winds, creating an area of relative
calm or lighter winds (but wave size in a storm is not affected). The
fan can be used for up to 8 hours. It does not function on land.</p>
      <a id="feather-token-swan-boat"></a><p><i>Swan Boat</i>: A token that forms a swanlike boat capable
of moving on water at a speed of 60 feet. It can carry eight horses and
gear or thirty-two Medium characters or any equivalent combination. The
boat lasts for one day.</p>
      <a id="feather-token-tree"></a><p><i>Tree</i>: A token that causes a great oak to spring into
being (5-foot diameter trunk, 60-foot height, 40-foot top diameter).
This is an instantaneous effect.</p>
      <a id="feather-token-whip"></a><p><i>Whip</i>: A token that forms into a huge leather whip and
wields itself against any opponent desired just like a dancing weapon.
The weapon has a +10 base attack bonus, does 1d6+1 points of damage,
has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and a makes a

two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a
quart of material. In fact, each is like a bag of holding and can
actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20

      <p>While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even

      <a id="helm-of-brilliance"></a><p><b>Helm of Brilliance</b>: This normal-looking helm takes its
true form and manifests its powers when the user dons it and speaks the
command word. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly
created helm is set with large magic gems: ten diamonds, twenty rubies,
thirty fire opals, and forty opals. When struck by bright light, the
helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions
from its crownlike, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels&rsquo; functions are
as
follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Diamond: Prismatic spray (save DC 20)</li>
        <li>Ruby: Wall of fire</li>
        <li>Fire opal: Fireball (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half )</li>
        <li>Opal: Daylight</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform
its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a
helm of brilliance also has the following magical properties when
activated.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet.
This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures
within that range.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a
flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon
may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The
command takes 1 round to take effect.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The helm provides resistance to fire 30. This protection
does not stack with similar protection from other sources.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its
powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys
it.</p>
      <p>If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire
(after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an
additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and
detonate. Remaining diamonds become prismatic sprays that each randomly
target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become
straight-line walls of fire extending outward in a random direction
from the helm wearer, and fire opals become fireballs centered on the
helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.</p>

water and light conditions would allow for normal human vision. (Weeds,
obstructions, and the like block vision in the usual manner.) If the
command word is spoken, the helm of underwater action creates a globe
of air around the wearer&rsquo;s head and maintains it until the

each round that the user continues to blow the horn; fog clouds travel
10 feet each round in a straight line from the emanation point unless
blocked by something substantial such as a wall. The device makes a

      <a id="marvelous-pigments"></a><p><b>Marvelous Pigments</b>: These magic emulsions enable their
possessor to create actual, permanent objects simply by depicting their
form in two dimensions. The pigments are applied by a stick tipped with
bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application to form
the desired object as the artist concentrates on the desired image. One
pot of marvelous pigments is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot
object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot
surface. </p>
      <p>Only normal, inanimate objects can be created. Creatures
can&rsquo;t
be created. The pigments must be applied to a surface. It takes 10
minutes and a DC 15 Craft (painting) check to depict an object with the
pigments. Marvelous pigments cannot create magic items. Objects of
value depicted by the pigments &mdash;precious metals, gems, jewelry,
ivory,
and so on&mdash; appear to be valuable but are really made of tin,
lead,
paste, brass, bone, and other such inexpensive materials. The user can
create normal weapons, armor, and any other mundane item (including
foodstuffs) whose value does not exceed 2,000 gp.</p>

attacks a target assigned to it. The grinning skull mask makes a touch
attack against the target based on the wearer&rsquo;s base attack
bonus. If
the attack succeeds, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be
struck dead, as if affected by a finger of death spell. If the target
succeeds on his saving throw, he nevertheless takes 3d6+13 points of

back to its user. The mask has AC 16, 10 hit points, and hardness 6.</p>

about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. It can be hung or
placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The
same command word deactivates the mirror. A mirror of life trapping has
fifteen nonspatial extradimensional compartments within it. Any
creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own
reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror
in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device
always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing
its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50%
if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid
looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).</p>
      <p>When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the
mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not
trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A
victim&rsquo;s equipment (including clothing and anything being
carried)
remains behind. If the mirror&rsquo;s owner knows the right command
word, he
can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface
and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word
frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to
each prisoner.</p>
      <p>If the mirror&rsquo;s capacity is exceeded, one victim
(determined
randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the
mirror is broken, all victims currently trapped in it are freed.</p>

          <p>Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as

          <p>Use it as a portal to visit other places. The user first
views the place with the clairvoyance function, then steps through the
mirror to the place pictured. Others can follow her through the mirror
if they like. An invisible portal remains on the other side where she
arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the
portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping
the user if she&rsquo;s still in the other place), and the user can
also
close it with a command word. Creatures with Intelligence of 12 or
higher might notice the portal just as they might notice a magical

mirror&rsquo;s surface, an exact duplicate of that creature comes into

The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who
can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the
end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14

diameter, but it can be folded up to be as small as a pocket
handkerchief. When spread upon any surface, it causes an
extradimensional space 10 feet deep to come into being. This hole can
be picked up from inside or out by simply taking hold of the edges of
the cloth and folding it up. Either way, the entrance disappears, but
anything inside the hole remains.</p>
      <p>The only air in the hole is that which enters when the hole is
opened. It contains enough air to supply one Medium creature or two
Small creatures for 10 minutes. The cloth does not accumulate weight
even if its hole is filled. Each portable hole opens on its own
particular nondimensional space. If a bag of holding is placed within a
portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in that place. Both
the bag and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a
portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the
Astral Plane. The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot
radius are drawn there, the portable hole and bag of holding being
destroyed in the process.</p>

of existence and within 100 miles of each other to function. Whatever
is put through one ring comes out the other, and up to 100 pounds of

through and then retracted do not count.) This useful device allows for
instantaneous transport of items or messages, and even attacks. A
character can reach through to grab things near the other ring, or even
stab a weapon through if so desired. Alternatively, a character could
stick his head through to look around. A spellcaster could even cast a
spell through a ring gate. A Small character can make a DC 13 Escape
Artist check to slip through. Creatures of Tiny, Diminutive, or Fine

unremarkable robe, but a character who dons it notes that it is adorned
with small embroidered figures representing undead creatures. Only the
wearer of the robe can see the embroidery and recognize them for the
creatures they become, and detach them. One figure can be detached each
round. Detaching a figure causes it to become an actual undead creature
(see the list below). The skeleton or zombie is not under the control
of the wearer of the robe, but may be subsequently commanded, rebuked,

can cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of incredible hues,
color after color cascading from the upper part of the robe to the hem
in sparkling rainbows of dazzling light. The colors daze those near the
wearer, conceal the wearer, and illuminate the surroundings. It takes 1
full round after the wearer speaks the command word for the colors to
start flowing on the robe. The colors create the equivalent of a gaze
attack with a 30-foot range. Those who look at the wearer are dazed for
1d4+1 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). This is a mind-affecting pattern
effect.</p>
      <p>Every round of continuous scintillation of the robe gives the
wearer better concealment. The miss chance on attacks against the

      <a id="rope-of-climbing"></a><p><b>Rope of Climbing</b>: A 60-foot-long rope of climbing is no
thicker than a wand, but it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds.
Upon command, the rope snakes forward, upward, downward, or in any
other direction at 10 feet per round, attaching itself securely
wherever its owner desires. It can unfasten itself and return in the
same manner.</p>
      <p>A rope of climbing can be commanded to knot or unknot itself.
This causes large knots to appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope.
Knotting shortens the rope to a 50-foot length until the knots are

addition, such obstructions as webs (magical or otherwise) do not
affect an anointed individual. Magic ropes and the like do not avail

a flask whose inside has been coated with 1 ounce of salve of
slipperiness, and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the
flask, a new application of the salve of slipperiness must be put in

summoning medium, the elemental that comes is Large instead, and the
stone functions as the summon monster VI spell.) The elemental appears

      <p>A stone horse can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never
needs to rest or feed. Damage dealt to it can be repaired by first
using a stone to flesh spell, thus causing the stone horse to become a
